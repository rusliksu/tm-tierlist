This corp doesn’t see much play in my area.\n\n1 plant production early game is nice, but you really need at least 1 more for it to be useful, or go for the plant placement bonuses. If not (for instance if you’re going for a Venus strategy) then the plants will just slowly accumulate until an asteroid takes them.\n\nThe 2mc from raising Venus is also nice, but in many games, Venus is raised only a few steps, or not at all. Standard Project Air Scrapping is still expensive with this at 15mc - 2mc = 13mc. You gain 0mc to 30mc with this. If Venus gets to 30%, and it’s not all very late game, the mc gain could get significant.\n\nWith Colonies and all the new promos added, cards that terraform Venus get more and more diluted. At least Venuphile is always an award, and you’re 1 ahead in that.\n\nA large factor is if the game is played with the World Government Terraform step in the Solar Phase. I used to play without it, bit now play with it, because it gives Venus cards a boost, and gives cards with Venus requirements a chance.\n\nAphrodite is a bit like Teractor; good starting funds, good tag(s) and a bit of mc from an effect. This sets you up for a solid start and shifts the focus from the corporation to the preludes and starting cards. If you have great cards in hand, some tag synergy, maybe matching milestones/awards, then Aphrodite can be a decent pick.\n\nThe other two Venus corporations are nothing like it. These give you Venus/floater starting cards, and really point you to a specific strategy.",

That's a value of 4.5 MC production per gen, which is quite high. If you happen to get a good asteroid card, such as one that removes as asteroid for a TR, that may be worth more than the 4.5 worth of titanium per gen. But it's unlikely as there aren't a ton of asteroid cards and some aren't that great. \n\nAstroDrill would be a lot worse if space tags were worse, as a lot of it's early game cash and all of its production is in the form of titanium. However, space tags tend to be quite powerful, and there tends to be enough of them to almost always spend your titanium.\n\nOverall, an A tier corp, not quite rising to the level of overpowered, but very strong and can easily landslide a game with a strong starting hand.

One of my biggest issues with celestic and other cards like it is that “cards with floater icons” includes some pretty worthless cards that don’t even accept floaters.  \n\nIf you don’t have a floater card that can accept floaters in your opening hand, and Celestic bricks on Floater Prototypes and Airliners or Floater Leasing, then you’re stuck with using the corp action on the corp card for a third of a point for a few gens.  \n\nIf we value cards at 3Mc each and the corp power at 10Mc, which is generous since floater technology does it at that price but also comes with a science tag, then you’re looking at a Corp with a total value of 58MC which is on the lower side. \n\nOverall I don’t value floater placement and 1/3 point acquisition very highly as a speculative ability.  Meaning, if your opening hand contains no targets for the floater, picking the corp is speculating on drawing a good floater card later.  \n\nUnlike other corps like, say, Credicor, the chance you draw a 20+ cost playable card is higher than the chance you draw a good floater card, and the base value of Credicor (discount on two standard projects) is about as valuable than the base value of Celestic (1/3 of a point per gen).",

Standard Projects are also affected by their ability. Normally, Standard Projects are supposed to be 4 MC more expensive than their cards. (See subterranean reservoir and power plant for examples). But Credicor now allows you to pay a fair price for greeneries and cities. This is particularly potent on the Tharsis map where both gardener and Mayor are milestones. Gardener is the better milestone since with only standard Projects, it is 65 MC for 8VP and 3TR without any cities next to the greeneries. You can always claim the milestone gen 2 even if you have a starting hand of unplayable cards.\n\nAs I mentioned, they do well with all strategies. Their ground game is strong with Standard Projects, It can use jovians efficiently since most of them cost more than 20. A lot of space events for a terraforming strategy are more than 20 MC, etc. Can never go wrong picking this corp.",

But energy production is a bit situational.\n\nIf playing with Colonies, that energy is always useful. It gives progress towards being able to trade. And of course, once you can trade, you can get another free energy production since you'll have no energy resources left after trading.\n\nFactorum works very well with cards that cost 1 energy production, like AI Central, Electro-Catapult, many of the city placement cards, etc. You can spend an energy production and then get it back for free very quickly. If you do this each gen, it's kind of like you have 7 or 8 MC production and are getting lucky with energy cards. In that case, you'll probably steamroll the table and win easily. But it's unlikely to find so many cards that cost 1 energy. Alternatively, a card that uses energy flexibly such as Energy Market can work wonders with Factorum.\n\nIf you can't gain energy production, Factorum's other ability is still worth using. Card draw is always powerful, and knowing it has a building tag means you can focus on steel production and know you'll have targets for it. If Ceres is in the game, that's a big advantage for Factorum.\n\nOverall, Factorum is top tier with Colonies, but only high tier without. It's a fun and flexible corp that may be slightly overturned because many of the promo corps are. Use the ability well and you'll have efficiency your opponents can't match.",

            "body": "This is from the Prelude 2 Kickstarter promo pack.\n\nThis promo pack adds 5 corporations, all compatible with the base game. Unfortunately, Kuiper Cooperative is probably the weakest, and though fun to play, not extremely interesting.\n\nIt comes with low starting funds (33mc) and not a lot to make up for that. It has 2 Space tags, that aren’t often useful, 1 titanium production, leaving it weak to Asteroid Mining Consortium, and an action/effect that gives you a resource worth 1mc per Space tag. The catch is not only that a lot of Space cards are events, but you can only spend those 1mc resources on Standard Project Asteroid or Aquifier!\n\nEven if you have a lot of Space/Wild tags (say 5+ of them) you only get 1mc for each every generation, and then must spend it on a 14mc Asteroid or 18mc Ocean. That’s just not very efficient. Also, Space cards are often for Engine games, and when playing that, you don’t particularly feel the need to raise temperature and end the game early.\n\nI’d consider picking it if the Spacefarer (4 Space tags) Milestone was in play, and I had Standard Technology, to lower the cost of Asteroids and Oceans to 11 and 15.\n\nOther good cards for Kuiper Cooperative are:\n\nAsteroid Mining Consortium, though if one of your opponents has it you’re toast.\n\nSatellites. Giving you 1mc production for every Space/Wild tag including Kuipers two. Note that Toll Station likely becomes a very good card for your opponents.\n\nSpace Station. And other Space tag discount cards. Also, other cheap little Space/Wild tag cards, like Space Mirrors, Research Coordination and Trans-Neptune Probe.\n\nThe Space Baron Award (most space tags). The Excentric Award is also interesting.\n\nNote that Prelude 1 only has 1(!) Prelude with a Space tag, and 1 with a Wild tag. So this doesn’t help Kuiper Cooperative much. Prelude 2 (including the promos) adds 2 preludes with a Wild tag, and 9 preludes with a space tag, all of them pretty good. (Although 6 of them require Venus and/or Colonies.) Kuiper Cooperative really wants Prelude 2 in the set up, preferably with extended start, so you pick 2 out of 6 preludes, and can fish out those Space/Wild tags.\n\nKuiper Cooperative originally was a fan made card; Kuiper Belt Cooperative https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1962850/new-corp-idea-kuiper-belt-cooperative and to be honest, it was better.\n\nThe fan made version is the same, but with 5mc more start credits, and an action/effect that lets you buy an Ocean or Venus TR for 12 of the 1mc resources. An ocean for 12 resources is much better than a temperature for 14 or ocean for 18.\n\nThe Prelude 2 kickstarter promo version is a bit more streamlined, but loses the Kuiper Belt theme. Originally, the logo was a comet, the resources were comets, and the theme was people in the Kuiper Belt sending comets (water ice) to the inner planets. The promo version replaces that with asteroid resources, and changes the logo.\n\nAnd now some trivia; The Kuiper belt is named after the Dutch astronomer Gerrit Pieter Kuiper, who was one of the people who discovered it. Kuiper is a Dutch name, and the “ui” is a sound not used in English. English speakers usually can’t pronounce the name “Kuiper” due to the “ui” sound being very hard to learn, and instead opt for Koiper belt, Kaiper belt, Kyper Belt or even Kweepuh belt.",

They do better in smaller player counts, presumably because the game is longer. The stats seem to show that they do extremely well at 2 and 3 players, and pretty average at more.\n\nTheir power is effectively \"you have an extra gen of non-TR production\", but it's distributed over the game. They effectively get a discount on production cards, but it also massively changes the sequencing options available to them. They can do things like drop energy production and energy consumers in the same generation.\n\nTheir starting resource value is only around 43M€. That's quite a big hole to climb out of, and really emphasises why they do better with longer games. Their power can only start seeing profit after the first 2-3 gens.\n\nI think the main reason that they're so consistently good is that you  don't have to have a plan for them.

This puts you ahead by net 6 MC production overall. This is a massive lead already. To balance it out, you have a downside. You owe 3 MC whenever someone attacks another player. However, attack cards are the minority of the deck. So it's likely that it won't come up every gen. \n\nThere's also a hidden benefit to Mons Insurance. Since players know you will get hurt if they attack another player, they are unlikely to attack you directly. So, you can usually count on your plants and productions to be safe.\n\nIn a 2 player game, the downside only comes up if you attack your opponent. Mons Insurance is widely considered to be top tier in 2 player and pretty much an auto pick. If you are banning any corps, Mons Insurance for 2 player is an obvious choice.\n\nMore players means it's more likely for attack cards to get drawn, making Mons Insurance slightly weaker as you will have to pay out money. At 3 players Mons Insurance is still top tier, but it is joined by Aridor, Poseidon, and other top tier corps as about the same level rather than a whole leg above everything else as it is in 2 player.\n\nAt 4 and 5 players Mons Insurance may go down to high tier, or maybe even middle tier. I honestly don't know because I haven't played a game with it at those player counts. It's such a feel bad start of the game to attack everyone's production that I'm happier removing it from the deck even for higher player counts when it might be more balanced.",

This assumes, of course, that you will actually be able to use the corp power.  \n\nMy experience with Nirgal is that it is really bad.  It has a rough time getting started due to low starting cash, and its corp power does not actually help it win the milestones, just buy them.  \n\nFunding awards isn’t as useful since there’s no guarantee you win them and Nirgal isn’t as good at winning awards as other corps which might have an effect that helps actually win them.\n\nOf the several times it’s been played at my table in 3p, it’s lost pitifully and only been able to get 1 milestone.  There’s just not enough money to snag multiple milestones before the other players take one, and everyone knows Nirgal wants milestones badly so there’s extra incentive to claim one as quick as possible to deny them. \n\nIts 30Mc start is padded out by production but it’s still waiting multiple gens to feel the benefit of the prod while other corps with bigger starting cash can come out of the gate gunning for a specific milestone.  \n\nThere’s also additionally the issue of diversifying your strategy/cards to meet the requirements for multiple milestones to get maximum benefit, but ending up spread thin and finding it difficult to win any of the awards against players who are more specialized.  I’ve never seen Nirgal effectively control the awards either as they usually must fund the 8Mc one early enough to give the other players runway to compete for it, or risk letting another player get the 8Mc award.",

The sweet spot is having 0-1 disease on this and some non-urgent science tags on hand, not grabbing 3TR too early as any extra microbe played can be transformed to an additional 1TR for 4BC, which is a good rate. Just be sure to be able to fully cure before the game ends - which is not really easy to manage even in 1v1, and in 4 players game the potential for not being able to catch up is much higher.\n\nPlaying against this monstrosity is also weird.

Corp ability is bonkers, placing greeneries or cities, it doesn't matter. Special tiles like commercial district? Oh, boy.\n\nThe only downside you might argue is that there are less merit for placing tiles next to oceans. But think of this: when another player places a tile next to Philares's AFTER Philares placed that tile, Philares still get to trigger its ability. That means, Philares doesn't care about oceans, they can place any tile (conveniently, you start with one) in a strategic point. \n\nWhat if no one place tiles next to Philares? One, that means Philares gets monopoly on good tile bonus plus efficient city VP, and two, Philares can still actively place next to other players' tiles.\n\nI cannot think of any corp that can reasonably compete with Philares. Maybe Posseidon in 5p? But in full expansion setting, MC don't solve everything. I can argue that action rebates are much more valuable.",

Nobody gives you space cards in draft, you have no mc/mc production to play your other cards, and no card draw.\n\nIt’s also easy to pick Phobolog because you have some very good space cards, and hope you get some titanium production later. You play the space cards turn 1, titanium production never comes your way, and you realize you picked a 63 cash corp with no action or practical effect.\n\nPhobolog is actually a low value corporation. It has high start funds, 63mc, but 40 of that is titanium. And the only other effect it has is a build in Mercurian Alloys, which is a 3mc card.\n\nOnly 20% of the cards in the deck have a space tag. (23% to 24% with expansions.) Phobolog has low starting mc, it can only buy 7 of the 10 start hand project cards. And then it has no mc left to play anything that isn’t a space card. It also doesn’t have good hopes for the Mikestones and Awards on the base game map.\n\nBecause of this it’s considered low tier.\n\nDespite this, Phobolog can perform well with the right preludes and cards. I remember a 2 player game where I had Phobolog, and had 7 titanium production by gen 4. I also had advanced alloys, so each titanium was worth 5. I had 59 income total (TR, mc and titanium) coming up for gen 5, and a hand full of good space cards, when I played AI Central for the card draw.\n\nGetting just the right preludes and cards to make Phobolog a good pick is somewhat rare in base+prelude, but it’s a bit easier with promos and expansions. These feature a higher percentage of space cards. The colony Triton can give some nice 4mc titanium. And building a colony there directly gives 3 titanium back, which is 12mc to Phobolog. Luna and Ceres gives income opportunity, and Pluto cards.\n\nPrelude 2 adds a bunch of space tag preludes, meaning Satellites can become a good gen 1 option for Phobolog. Old Mining Colony and Space Lanes are also good preludes for Phobolog.\n\nNew Maps and Milestones&Awards introduce Milestones and Awards that Phobolog can actually compete in. Like Legend (4 or 5 event cards) on Elysium, Space Baron (most space tags) on Hellas, and Spacefarer (4 space tags) on Vastitas Borealis.",

Relative to other corporations, you are starting with around 18 more value, meaning that if you want to keep 9 cards, you've already worn your lead down. That will often happen within the first 3 generations.\n\nAn important note: I said *want to keep*, not *keep*. Every time you don't keep a card you would normally want to keep, that's still penalizing you, and probably for more than 2MC value. Playing low to the ground with few cards may seem like a solid strategy, but realistically it's just not worth the extra 2MC to give up cards you would otherwise play.\n\nBut the cherry on the cake for me is a simple fact:\n\nThis corporation is not fun.\n\nYou have a penalty, but the reward is just generic resources.

Even the only guiding resource, titanium, will be gone in 1-2 generations, leaving you with only a penalty and some semi-decent MC production that is just usable for anything; you might as well be a beginner corp with a penalty at that point.\n\nIf I were to rate the power of this corp, it's D tier. If I were to rate the fun, it's F tier.",

If you rise TR every fourth generation, you get 18 MC per four gens, which is 4,5 MC production, without the starting penalty it is 2,5 MC income. With rise every third gen it is 12 MC per three gens, which is 4 MC per gen, with the initial penalty it results to 2 MC income.\n\n... and that is just not good, considering that you will be also losing a bit of cash here and there by restraining from increasing TR on generations when it might be good (and there are a few TR-matters things which don't go well with this corp too). Also if you draw into good plants production, will you sit on the plants, risking plant destruction and the opponents occupying good spots? Or if you get some terraforming bacteria and something that adds microbe to it so you can't easily stash the terraforming resources for later?\n\nThe only thing that can potentially save this corp is the points. But you already start with -2 points penalty. So if you activate this 7 times, you end up with +5 points in total. That is not bad, but given all the disadvantages not great either.\n\nThe corporation can still be good. You have decent starting cash and even if the average income will drop through the game, you can plan and control the first turns decently and get some early game boost. And if you are lucky on cards and assemble engine so good that you don't want to terraform (like using starting cash and boost for early AI central and then drawing onto cards that give income and points), then it is fine. But it feels rarely powerful and the risk of drawing into cards that don't go well with it is very real.\n\nI sometimes play this vs newer players or if I have zero support for the other corps and have no terraforming cards on the opening hand, or if the opening hand can be explosive with enough cash.

That’s terrible, and you’re basically making sure you and your target don’t win.\n\nStill, in my local area it sometimes does see play in gen 1. Sometimes a player who doesn’t win often can use it against someone who’s on a winning streak or has high rating. That way he’ll hopefully get 2nd or 3rd place, above the player who was the target for hackers. And then he can brag about beating the top player, and he’ll gain rating.\n\nIt can also be used to check a player with Tharsis on the Tharsis board, with good preludes, in 4p base+prelude. And it’s sometimes used for petty reasons or kingmaking.\n\nPlaying Hackers in gen 1 VS Robinson, so it needs to use its ability to get mc production and is basically screwed, is a bit of a meme opening.\n\nIf someone plays that, he may not win the game, but will have something to brag about on whatsapp and discord. That’s why I said some players “think it’s funny”. It’s not a good move if you want to win, but it can be a good move if you want to remove the robinson player from the game.\n\nAnother such meme opening is playing Birds (-2 plant production) with Ecology Experts on Ecoline during the Prelude phase.\n\nOr playing Sabotage with Headstart on Phobolog, so it can’t play the preludes Galilean Mining or Business Empire because it doesn’t have enough mc.\n\nAt least that last discussion, and others like it about Headstart, lead to the official rule that you get 15mc instead of nothing if your prelude fizzles.",

Other maps and expansions also make it worse by shifting the focus away from the ground game and more towards card synergies.\n\nAveraged across all formats, it's probably a mid-tier corp.",

It’s considerd bottom tier. Sometimes even the worst corporation in base+prelude.\n\nIts start mc, production and tag together give it somewhat low value (56), so its effect has to make up for that. But it doesn’t. In any game you’ll want a bit of energy production, usually to play cards, and with Colonies you may want 3 or even 6 energy production (although there are many other ways to trade or gain energy). 1 or 2 power tag cards will get Thorgate there. Playing more than 3 power tag cards, if you even have them, may not add much usefulness. And the Standard Project Power Plant at 11-3=8mc is still pretty expensive.\n\nUsing Thorgates effect 2 or 3 tines gives it a value of only 62 or 65. That’s very low. Average is in the 70s, with some corporations much higher. Compare to a solid mid tier corporation like Teractor. That one has 60mc. Even if it bought SP Power Plant (11mc) it’d still have more start mc than Thorgate. It has a more useful tag. It has the same 3mc discount effect on tags, but on a more useful one; some Earth tags are really strong early game, and there are still a lot that are good mid game or late game. That’s not the case with power tag cards. In short, with Teractor you get 3mc discount on cards you’d play anyway, and in most games you’ll play more than 3.\n\nOf course Thorgate can be your best pick out of 2 or 3 corporations. You may have 2 good power tag cards in your hand, like Solar Wind Power and Power Supply Consortium. If you can use the 48 start mc, you can have a very solid start, especially in a Colonies game.",

It isn't. It's probably closer to 4 and 3, because MC production is bad late and VP is bad early. It might even be worse than that due to how low the synergy is between them.\n\nBut then this isn't even that good overall. At 40MC starting value, that's a 25MC power. 25MC is a little over 6MC in value per turn in production. Which would be the value you get from using this *every single turn*. But... you don't necessarily do that, especially in early generations. And again, 25MC is *more* costly than 6MC per turn in value.\n\nSo it's a poor return on investment in TR, and TR itself is a poor return on investment.

You get 3mc back for every card with VP, and that about 40% of the deck!! (Both in base+prelude and with expansions). These are cards you’d want to play anyway in a lot of cases. And it makes some cheap cards normally not worth it pretty good due to the 3mc bonus. It’s much stronger with draft since that’ll let you fish out more VP cards. It’s also pretty impossible to hatedraft Vitor, since VPs are on 40% of the deck.\n\nEngine play with card draw is essential for Vitor, and with enough generations, it can win with a large lead.\n\nThe other effect is that you remember you had to fund a reward as your first action in gen 1 somewhere during gen 2.

You can decide whether to raise Venus to unlock some Venus cards (there are some very good), or just to speed the game a bit by going for oxygen. Even the temperature has its use if you get a free ocean for it.\n\nI also really like the concept of \"draw tags\" cards or in this case, draw floater cards. You can still draw very unuseful cards with floater icons, so it makes most sense to play this when you already have at least one decent floater card on hand, otherwise it is a bit risky.\n\nThe only bad thing about this card is that as with many Venus cards, the Venus tag alone is a bit meh and it can't be payed by steel or titanuim, which makes the card somewhat expensive. The value, especially if you have some floaters payoff, is still nice though, especially in longer games.",

The average for a prelude 1 card is 24.5. However, people pick the best 2 preludes out of 4, so the actual average value of played prelude cards is 27. Times two is 54. 19mc more, on average, than 35. That’s a massive disadvantage.\n\nLooking beyond quantified value, what Ecoline needs in gen 1 is a bit of income (mc, metals or TR). These preludes leave Ecoline with 0 TR and -2 mc production. This is really bas especially for Ecoline.\n\nYou get 1 heat production, which can be turned into 1 temperature in gen 9 when the game is already over. The heat production is good if you can get more, but you need mc for that.\n\nThe power production is nice if you have a good city card. However, that costs mc.\n\nThe total of 5 plant production is good for Ecoline of course. But unless you’re start player in gen 2, those 5 plants have a decent chance to get removed by an asteroid. After which it’s oractically game over.\n\nBiosphere Support and Society support are really bad compared to other preludes that give a plant production: Biofuels, Dome Farming, Early Settlement, Nitrogen Shipment, Ecology Experts… there’s also Experimental Forest that gives an income, placement bonus and 2 plabt cards!\n\nBiosphere Support + Society Support:\n\n3 plant prod. 1 heat prod. 1 power prod. 1 plant tag. -2 mc prod.\n\nCompare that with for instance Biofuels + Polar Industries:\n\n1 plant prod. 2 heat prod. 1 power prod. 2 plants. 1 ocean (2 plants). microbe tag. builder tag.\n\nWith the ocean you can get 2 plants. With Ecoline that’s 7 plants -> turn 1 Greenery (next to ocean for 2mc). You now start the game with 2TR (2 income) instead of -2 mc production. With 2 heat prod. instead of 1. And with a greenery already down instead of  plant production.\n\nGreat Aquifier (2 oceans) is even better. And these oceans unlock plant cards with requirements for Ecoline.\n\nHuge Asteroid is also great, gives 3TR (3 income) and a heat production. And helps with temperature requirement plant cards.\n\nBest prelude scenario for Ecoline is Ecology Experts + Kelp Farming/Trees.

Luckily this Prelude moves all tracks 2 steps up!\n\nThis trade is worth (in quantified value):\n\nLuna: 9M€ (9mc)\nCeres: 6 Steel (12mc)\nTriton: 3 Titanium (9mc)\nPluto: +3 cards -1 card (~7mc)\nGanymede: 4 plants (~9mc)\nIo: 8 heat (~10mc)\nCallisto: 8 energy (~11mc)\nEuropa: 1 Energy production + 1M€ (~8mc)\n\nIt’s unlikely but possible that these are active:\n\nMiranda: 2 animals + 1 card (~11mc)\nEnceladus: 4 microbes (~12mc)\nTitan: 3 floaters (~12mc)\n\nA Colony plus 9 to 12mc in trade value gives this Prelude a value of 22 to 25mc.\n\nThis might be average value for a Prelude(2) card, but because of the flexibility, it’s very good. 9mc might be exactly what you need to play a big card. Or you might have Advanced Alloys so the steel is worth 18 mc and the titanium 12mc. 8 heat can give you a Temperature TR and maybe a heat production bonus. 4 plants lets Ecoline place a Greenery (on a nice placement bonus).\n\n8 energy can give you 1 Oxygen TR + metals from an oxygen bumper card (played with Head Start or Ecology Experts) and you’ll have 4 energy left! 2 animals is worth 2VP if you have a 1VP animal from Ecology Experts. This can ve very strong in a 5 player game.\n\nEarly Colonization is of course extra good if you are Poseidon, not only getting +1 mc production, but also setting the other colony tracks 2 steps forward for your next trade with your other colony, and possibly enticing other players to trade and maybe build a colony before trading -something they might eschew otherwise due to you being Poseidon.\n\nIt can be a very good pick in 4 player games with Luna, ensuring you are not the player without a colony on Luna.\n\nEarly Colonization is better if someone else already played a Colony (with cards like Old Mining Colony, Strategic Base Planning, Poseidon, or the placement bonus on Terra Cimeria.) You can trade with step 5 on the colony tiles:\n\nLuna: 12M€ (12mc)\nCeres: 8 Steel (16mc)\nTriton: 4 Titanium (12mc)\nPluto: +4 cards -1 card (~10mc)\nGanymede: 5 plants (~11mc)\nIo: 10 heat (~12mc)\nCallisto: 10 energy (~14mc)\nEuropa: 1 plant production + 1M€ (~11mc)\nMiranda: 2 animals + 1 card (~11mc)\nEnceladus: 5 microbes (~15mc)\nTitan: 4 floaters (~16mc)\n\nEarly Colonization can be even better if you play this prelude a bit later in the game via Board of Directors or WG Project, when you have 2 trade fleets and the Colony tiles are filled with colonies.",

And it’s usuless if you don’t have a card over ~21mc you want to play in the prelude phase.\n\nI wanted to calculate the odds:\n\nIn base+prelude there are about 9 cards that are 25mc or more that you’d want to play gen 1. Think Io Mining Industries or Giant Ice Asteroid. (One of these has a 1 Jovian tag requirement.) There’s also Strip Mine, but you need a prelude with 2 energy production as your other prelude.\n\nThere are also a few 25+ mc cards that are not worth it in gen 1 (Phobos Space Haven, Aerobraked Ammonia Asteroid), or that you want to play later (Large Convoy, NRE).\n\nThere are also 5 23mc card you might want to play (Earth Catapult, Protected Valley, Ice Asteroid.) And there’s Domed Crater that might be an option.\n\nDo the math and the chance that you get at least one 25+ mc playable card in your 10 starting cards in base+prelude is ~38%. If you add 23mc cards, it’s ~54%.\n\nNote that these cards may not always fit your strategy. If you’re sure you want go go engine, Deimos Down is not a great pick. Remove the terraforming cards from the pool and the odds drop to 21%. 35% if you add the 23mc cards.\n\nSo, the sentiment that this card is useless over half of the time is correct.\n\nIn some situations, this prelude does offer additional benefits:\n\nIf you are 3rd or 4th in a 4 player game, and you have an ocean(s) project card, you can use this prelude to play your ocean first and grab a placement bonus. The same is true for (special) tile placement, like Mohole, Lava Flows or Protected Valley, on Olympus Mons).\n\nAs a card with no tag, Excentric Sponsor is worth 4mc extra to Sagitta. And 1mc production if you have Community Services. There’s also a most no tag csrds award.\n\nStill, this card is useful less than half the time. There are a bunch of other preludes that can be (near) useless; Ecology Experts, Society Support, Double Down. Prelude 2 adds a bunch more. So you can end up with only 2 (or even less!) playable preludes, limiting your choice greatly.\n\nPrelude 2 adds the “Extended Start” option to remedy this; start with 3 corporations and 6 preludes to pick from. (pick from 3 corporations is already the tournament standard).",

So quite  often, it’s useless.\n\nTo answer the question (and be original), I like to pair the card with the prelude Experimental Forest. Which gives you a forest and 2 plant cards. One of those plant cards is hopefully a good option to play with Ecology Experts. You’ll have a forest and plant production for Gardener, and already 4 bio tags for Biologist.\n\nThis happened in a national tournament last year, someone played Ecoline, Ecology Experts, Experimental Forest, and drew Kelp Farming. That’s Ecoline with 6 plant production, 7 plants, and mc production, and a forest and extra card, before the first action phase even started. The rest played for 2nd place.\n\nKelp farming is by far the best card for Ecology Experts. Second place is Farming, and third place Trees. Penguins is also very strong, but that depends on your corporation (you need mc/income) and player count (penguins likes a lot of generations).\n\nBirds need to eat plant production, but it can totally destroy an Ecoline player.\n\nThis prelude is often used by inexperienced players to try and play any requirement card (it only works on global parameter requirements (oceans, oxygen, temperature, venus). And it’s often played just for the sake of it, with a card that isn’t particularly strong. Ecology Experts is only great with a specific handful of cards.",

The standard resource will usually be titanium (worth 3mc) but you can also go for steel or plants.\n\nIt’s comparable to existing preludes that give 2 titanium or plant production:\n\nGalilean Mining gives 2 titanium production, and also a Jovian tag and -5mc.\n\nMetals Company gives 6mc in value production but it’s titanium, steel and mc. And it has no tag.\n\nOrbital Construction Yard has the space tag, only 1 titanium production and 4 titanium up front.\n\nLastly Biosphere Support has 2 plant production, and a very nice plant tag, at the cost of a rather crippling -1mc production.\n\nFloating Trade Hub has a catch too: the action is an OR action. Meaning, you start out better than titanium production, gaining floaters in gen 1, but every generation you cash in your floaters, you don’t get your 2 floaters that gen!\n\nI think you’re best off cashing in the floaters twice, maybe early/midgame with a good space card or maybe 8 plants for a greenery, and then in the last generation, for a big space card. That way the floater action’ll be worth just 2 titanium less than normal titanium production.\n\nHaving titanium production hidden in floaters can have benefits: It can’t be stolen with Asteroid Mining Consortium. And it can be good if you’re Robinson Industries. Of yourse if you HAVE AMC then you actually need a normal titanium production. The benefit of plants hidden as floaters is of course that they can’t be destroyed by asteroids.\n\nFloating Trade Hub is great for the Spacefarer Milestone (4 space tags), the Hoverlord Milestone, which is in every game if you play with Venus, and if you play as Kuiper Cooperative, or have Satellites.\n\nVery good with Phobolog or Advanced/Mercurian Alloys.\n\nMost floater cards are in Venus and Colonies, but Floating Trade Hub is fine on its own, so you can play it with just base+prelude, or add promos or turmoil.\n\nOf course if you play it with Venus and Colonies it becomes better. If Titan is in play, it’s activated in gen 1, and it can turn this prelude in a reliable titanium machine.\n\nThe creators where very nice and made this a card that can add 2 floaters to ANY card, which can make it a pretty nice combo with other floater cards. For instance 1 floater from Atmo Collectors is worth not 1 but 2 titanium.\n\nMost floater cards are also OR action cards, so by using the transaction action you miss out on a floater. Floating Trade Hub generously supplies 2 floaters, so you can use your other floater card transaction actions a lot. One floater can be worth: 2 Titanium, 1 energy producton, 1 mc production, 1 free trade, 1/2VP, 4 heat or half a TR.",

            "body": "One of the worst preludes, when compared in quantified value. Preludes, on average, are worth between 24mc and 25mc. Only a few are worth over 30mc, and only five are worth 20 or less. Two of those are the Jovian tag preludes, but only if you don't value the Jovian tag. The other three are the infamous Society Support, Biosphere Support, and Loan.\n\nThe calculation for the quantified value of this prelude is really easy. A mc production is worth 5mc. So this prelude is worth 30 - 2 \\* 5 = 20mc. Some people use 4.5 as a value for mc production, then the value will be 21mc. You can also argue that losing mc production is worse, because you lose a larger protion procentually. In that case Loan will be worth 19.5mc.  \nIn any case, it's really low value.\n\nYou can easily illustrate this by playing Loan and Sponsors, which will negate the 2 mc production loss:  \nSponsors costs 6mc and 3mc to buy into hand, and 1 of your 10 starting card spots, and you'll get: 21mc and an Earth tag. Not great for a prelude. And it doesn't even come with a tag.\n\nIt's the worst out of all the pure money preludes, again in quantified value:  \nLoan = 19.5mc  \nDonation = 21mc  \nAllied Banks = 23mc and an Earth tag  \nBusiness Empire = 24mc and an Earth tag\n\nThe game creators have intentionally made the preludes that give a bunch of money (Loan, Donation) worth less, because early money can be really strong. And that is why this card, despite being low value, can sometimes be playable or even good. There are 2 scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: You have Loan and two or three really bad preludes, or ones that don't tie into your strategy at all. For instance Excentric Sponsor and/or Ecology Experts, and nothing to play it on. Or the before mentioned Support preludes. In that case, the money from the loan doesn't look so bad.\n\nScenario 2 is more interesting:  \nIf you have really good, but expensive, cards in your starting hand, that you really want to play as soon as possible. 30mc can enable that. Especially useful if you are a low starting fund corporation.  \nFor instance if you can play Io Mining Industries in turn 1, you'll get an extra 2 Titanium and 2mc compared to playing it in turn 2. Same with Earth Elevator, for 3 Titanium.  \nIt can also give you the funds needed to play A.I. Central in turn 1 (you need 21mc, an energy production and 3 science tags for that), which will give you an extra 2 cards.  \nOr a turn 1 Strip Mine. That will give you 2 steel, 1 titanium and 2TR.\n\nYou could add the value you get from playing these cards 1 generation sooner, to the value of Loan. So 19.5mc plus \\~9mc is 28.5mc.  \nSo, situationally, with the right cards, Loan can be above average to pretty good.\n\nTL;DR low value prelude that gives a bunch of money. Situational, often pretty weak, but with the right cards can be avove average to pretty good.",

HOWEVER, 30mc cash is REALLY useful.\n\nIf this money allows you to play a card in gen 1 that gives you a lot compared to if you played it in gen 2, then it can be very much worth it.\n\nFor instance, use the money to play Space Elevator, and you get an extra round of production (titanium) and an extra action (steel->5mc). Loan is now worth 20+6=26 making it very playable if your other preludes are worse.\n\nAnd extra production round for asteroid Mining is worth 6mc. 7 for Saturn Systems. 8 for Phobolog. 9 or 10 for those corps with Advanced Alloys. That can turn Loan into a 26-30 value prelude.\n\nIf it lets you play Io Mining a gen sooner, that’s 8mc. 10mc for Phobolog. 12mc with Mercurian/Advanced Alloys. Phobolog has low starting funds, with this combo it can have a great start.\n\nAnother card like this is Earth Elevator. 3 titanium extra by playing it in gen 1 instead of 2. That’s 12 in mc for Phobolog. 15 with an Alloy card.\n\nSoletta is another option. 7 heat is worth a bit over 8mc.\n\nOr Giant Ice Asteroid. That’s 4mc in TR income. AND you get to place the oceans in gen 1, on the good spots with placement bonus hopefully.\n\nSo, as long as Loan let’s you play a strong card (or a combination of cards) that you otherwise couldn’t play in gen 1, that gives you value over what it’s worth less than your other preludes (usually about 5 to 9 mc) it’s a good pick.\n\nThis is an example of a really low value prelude that can be good, and sometimes even great, with the right corporation and card combo.",

Most Preludes are going to be more impactful in most situations.\n\nThis might be worth playing if I've got Rotator Impacts in my hand. Maybe. A free TR generation every Generation is certainly worth considering, so long as my opponents aren't pushing Venus heavily.\n\nAsteroid Deflection System is decent, about the same tier as Rotator Impacts, but it does cost an Energy production and is twice as expensive (assuming you factor in the 3 MC purchase costs) as Rotator Impacts. We always play Colonies, so anything that costs Energy Production is getting scrutinized pretty hard. Probably a clear pick for the player who wants to hoard a lot of plants though, honestly.\n\nI'd consider it situational with Asteroid Rights. It at least becomes easy income generation there. I'm not sure that's worth a Prelude without something specific to spend that potential Titanium on.\n\nOceans go fast in our games and Comet Aiming is relatively expensive, so I wouldn't play that combo. Directed Impactors is decent here, but it will push you towards a Rush strategy a bit. Icy Impactors is basically a worse version of Comet Aiming in this scenario.\n\nAsteroid Hollowing is 100% irrelevant. The only benefit to the card if you put an Asteroid Resource directly on it is 1/2 a point, and the Prelude already does that.\n\nKuiper Cooperative is a generally weak corporation. Taking a Prelude that costs 5 MC when you only start with 33 is rough no matter what. I would consider this a trap combo. \n\nAstrodrill has the same MC problem, only with 35 MC instead of 33. The only real benefit is that Main Belt Asteroids + Astrodrill can combo to get you 1 VP/turn on Main Belt Asteroids or, if by some miracle you have Astrodrill, Asteroid Deflection System, and Main Belt Asteroids all in your opening hand, you have an immediate, guaranteed 2 VP/Generation engine for the cost of 21 MC and 1 Energy Production. With Asteroid Deflection Systems' action, if you flip Space tags, that can jump up to 3 VP/Generation if you're lucky. That's probably worth considering, even without Asteroid Deflection system, especially if you have early Energy Production from another Prelude. But you pretty much must have a very specific opening hand to make this work.\n\nEDIT: Typos, broke up corporation analysis into two paragraphs.",

Meaning you pick 2 preludes from 6 instead of 4.\n\nThe “quantified value” of this prelude is pretty good, but you get a mixed bag of stuff that isn’t all good in gen 1.\n\nMost notably, you get 2VP (value 8 to 10) which is great when counting points after the last round, but doesn’t help your early Economy. (Except for Vitor who gets 3mc).\n\n2 cards (value ~6) is very good, but these are requirement cards. Some requirement cards have a max requirement, but most have a minumum requirement. Often a tag requirement. A bunch of them aren’t playable until mid or even late game. The Wild tag does help a bit with the tag requirements.\n\nThe Wild tag (value ~7) can be very strong, but you need specific cards/Milestones for it to be of use. Lastly, 5mc is always nice. Total “quantified value” is ~26 to ~28 which is slightly above average (25).\n\nNobel Prize has synergy with a few cards, but is mostly relevant for Milestones and Awards. Milestones would be the reason to pick this prelude. It is relevant for at least 1 Milestone on all 7 maps, but it’s best on Hellas where the Wild tag helps with Rim Settler and Diversifier, and you get 2 cards for Tactician.\n\nSynergy:\n\nCutting Edge Technology gives 2mc discount on each of your requirement cards.\n\nNobel Prize is worth 1 mc production with Community Services.\n\nVitor gives 3mc when you play this prelude.\n\nSagitta gives 4mc when you play this prelude.\n\nThe Wild tag is great with cards like Insects, Worms, Satellites, Medical Lab, Cartel, Miranda Resort, Lunar Mining, Luna Metropolis, Terraforming Ganymede, Galilean Waystation, Sulphur Exports, Interplanetary Trade, and of course cards with a (science) tag requirement.\n\nMilestones: Planner (16 cards in hand), Tactician (5 or 4 (M&A) cards with a requirement), Philantropist (5 cards with non negative VP), Rim Settler (3 Jovian tag) Ecologist (3 bio tags), Builder (8 or 7 (M&A) Building tags), Planetologist, Researcher (4 Science tags), Spacefarer, Terran (5 Earth tags), Diversifier (8 different tags), Architect (3 City tags), Agronomist (4 plant tags).\n\nAwards: Administrator (most cards with no tag), Forecaster (most cards with a requirement).\n\nTL;DR Do not play unless you’re pretty sure it can give you 1 or 2 milestone(s) and/or you have very good use(s) for the Wild tag.",

But if you draw something that gives you a pile of MC, that's probably going to be better than this card. That doesn't even factor in the cards that might just have other effects that are better for your hand and game plan.\n\nThe biggest use for it is if you have something that requires 1 Titanium per turn to activate. This can turn that on very quickly.\n\nSo, straight to the middle of the pile for this card. It isn't bad. It isn't exceptionally good. I don't usually hate seeing it, but I hope for something better.",

            "body": "Ridiculously strong Prelude. Though fun too play, I’ve taken it out of the deck. I’ll soon replace it with the version that was posted here that makes you discard your other prelude instead of 3 cards, and gives a science tag.\n\nProject Eden in quantified value is ~14 (city) + 14mc (ocean) + ~19 (greenery) -9mc (3 cards) + plant tag + city tag = ~39mc. That’s WAY above the normal value of preludes, which is between 20 and 30mc.\n\nWith Double Down and Tharsis or Lakefront Resorts, it can lead to a start where your opponents might as well give up.\n\nEarly VP (city, greenery) and TR (ocean, oxygen) is less good in 2 player. You might keep this prelude in if you only play 2 player, or solo, but it’s OP in 4 and 5 player.\n\nExample: with Tharsis on Tharsis map and Project Eden + Double Down, you can place 2 oceans, 3 cities and 3 greeneries in turn 1. You gain 19mc from adjacency bonus, have 4 plants, 5TR, 3mc production and 9VP on the board. In turn 2 you can claim Mayor and Gardener for another 10VP. (You’ll have 34mc minus the start hand cards you buy (max 7).)\n\nLakefront Resorts can do something similar with Project Eden and Double Down, but with just 2 cities, 4 plants, 5TR, 8VP on the map, 2 mc production, and 52mc left after claiming Gardener as its second action.\n\nLakefront Resorts is also good with Project Eden + Great Aquifer; 1 city, 3 plants, 5TR, 4VP on the map, 3 mc production, and 55mc left after claiming Gardener as its second action.\n\nWith Project Eden you don’t have to place your tiles next to each other. If start player, on Elysium, you can opt for  3 titanium and 3 cards (you can use cards from Olympus Mons to pay for Project Eden). If you do that Project Eden is worth 2TR, 1 greenery VP, 3 titanium and 3 cards, plant tag etc ie >40.\n\nOn Hellas you can claim 2 titanium with the ocean and the south pole ocean (2/3 Polar Explorer) or 4 steel.\n\nTerra Cimmeria can give you a colony for 5mc, 2 cards and 2 titanium, plus the 2TR and greenery VP.\n\nAmazonis Planitia can give you 4 cards and 2 delegates with your 3 tile placements. That’s ~22 value on top of the 2TR and greenery VP.\n\nThere are so many situations and combinations where Project Eden is ridiculous. No other prelude lets you place 3 tiles. And -3 cards (9mc cost) is just not much of a penalty.\n\nEdit: Project Eden + Experimental Forest also let’s you get 8 plants so you can play a third Greenery to instantly claim Gardener. Same with Project Eden + Philares. Or Ecoline + Project Eden + Great Aquifer.",

However, gen 1 cities aren’t great, they can get boxed in by special tiles. Ideally, you want cash, income and TR from your prelude value, not points.\n\nIn quantified value it’s ~14 for the city, 10 for the mc income and ~1 for the building tag, so ~25, which is around average.\n\nIt’s good on base game map (Tharsis), due to the Mayor (1/3), Gardener and Builder (1/8) Milestones, and Landlord and Banker award.\n\nIt’s less good on Hellas and Elysium. Although on Hellas you could get the 6mc ocean with it, to place on the 2 titanium ocean spot. But it’s not a great place for a city. The Olympus spot on Elysium is bad for cities, there’s only 2 spots for a greenery. A 2 mc production 3 card prelude is not great.\n\nIt’s good on Utopia Planitia on the spot with 2 cards and 1 titanium. There’s the Metropolist award. And on Terra Cimmeria you can go for the 5mc Colony and the 3 city tags Milestone! (Architect)\n\nOn Amazonis Planitia you can go for the 2 delegates spot, and then for the Landshaper (1 city, 1 greenery, 1 special tile) Milestone, and the Lobbyist Milestone (7 (all) delegates in parties), you can outpace your opponents on that one. There’s also the Constructor Award (most Colonies and Cities).\n\nIt’s not great on Vastitas Borealis, although you can go for Geologist.\n\nAs for corporations:\n\nTharsis loves this. Especially on base game map. It gets 3mc and 1mc production extra, making it a 30+ prelude. Tharsis free first action city tends to get boxed in by opponents special tiles. Not much of a problem if you have 2 cities.\n\nIt’s good for Mining Guild, you can get a titanium production with it, turning it into a high value prelude.\n\nCredicor likes this, it has the money to play ground game with 19mc greeneries.\n\nSpire gets a 2mc science resource when playing this.\n\nPhilares is “protected” from special tiles surrounding the early city. It gets a standard resource of choice if people do.\n\nFor Ecoline this prelude can be good or bad. If you play ground game Ecoline, it’s good, you get a city -which Ecoline normally doesn’t have the mc for- and can easily surround it with Greenery for VP. But if you play TR rush Ecoline, this can be bad; you want the game to end as fast as possible (so in gen 6 or 7 in 4 player) and a city doesn’t help. You’d be better off playing a prelude that raises a global parameter. You can play this city prelude, and then be 1 or 2 steps from finishing the game in gen 7, and lose because of that. The city may be worth 5 or 6VP, but the extra gen is worth MORE VP for your opponents. I’ve seen Ecoline win and lose in both ways; winning by ending the game early from TR and Milestones/Awards, losing from not being able to end it, winning with massive points from cities and greeneries, and losing due to building greeneries fot other people to build cities next to.\n\nAs for other preludes:\n\nSelf-sufficient Settlement is better than Early Settlement. 2 mc production is more flexible and useful than 1 plant production.\n\nIt’s a bit less good than Strategic Base Planning. That one gives you a colony and -3mc. A Colony is usually worth more than 2 mc production. (You can just place it on Luna for 2 mc production.)\n\nProject Eden is much stronger. You get a city, a greenery and an ocean, and -3 cards. A Greenery and an ocean is worth much more than 2 mc production, even if you pay 3 cards (9mc).",

At (almost) 30, this preludes value is much higher than the average of 25, and it’s often a good pick. There’s only 14 oxygen TR in the game, for 2 to 5 players, and after this there’s only 12, discouraging people who wanted to play a greenery strategy or an oxygen bumper.\n\nHowever, it isn’t always a good pick. If you don’t have good building cards to spend the 5 steel on in gen 1, this card is much less useful. Also, if you’re planning on a long game (engine) you may not want to bring game end 2 steps closer in gen 1. And if you’re Ecoline you may not want to cut into the oxygen track. You might also have cards with a max oxygen requirement in hand, like Natural Preserve (max 4%), Martian Survey (max 4%) or Hermetic Order of Mars (max 4%). In a 4 player game, if you aren’t the start player, you may never be able to play these.\n\nSmelting Plant is extra good if you have Advanced Alloys or Rego Plastics, making the steel worth 15mc. It’s also great if you want to play min. oxygen requirement cards, like Decomposers (3%) or Small Animals (6%). Or if you have cards that require or reward terraforming like UNMI or Terraforming Deal.",

The logic the designers likely used for Supplier goes like this: \n\nEach energy production is worth 7, and 4 steel provides 8 MC towards building tags. But that's not as liquid as MC itself, so let's subtract 1. \n\n7+7+8-1= 21\n\nHowever, energy production is not always easy to get at the rate of 7 each. Playing with Colonies means energy will be very important to get. Also, many cards that cost energy production also have building tags, such as many city cards, Electro Catapult, and AI Central. It could also bring you closer to using one of the oxygen pumping cards like Steelworks, that conveniently also have building tags. So if you have any use for the energy, you likely also have an easy time spending the steel.\n\nThis puts Supplier at above the 21 value when playing with Colonies or when you have any other good use for the energy. However, without a use for it, Supplier can be a big miss. Taking it and hoping to find a use for the energy later may result in stunting your economic growth and making it an uphill battle from the start.",

But having fewer players makes the game go longer, as does Venus, as does a lot of things. And notably this prelude doesn't make the game shorter, because the TR isn't tied to any parameter.\n\nSo yes, sometimes I will value this over, say, Minerals Company. If it's a 4p game that is likely to terraform quickly, sure. I just don't agree that it is forever and always a better choice, because sometimes the cards that Minerals Company will potentially let you play are worth a whole lot more than 3vp. \n\nAlso, if a game is going to go shorter, then preludes that give you upfront cash or resources are going to be more valuable.

            "body": "Good question! The game is “ruined” if play fun didn’t meet expectations for most or all players and the game end leaves players unsatisfied.\n\nThe game (with prelude!) is designed to be 7 to 12 generations long, with 8 to 10 generations being common. If it drops to 6 generations, or even 5, then generation 1 production cards are not worth buying. For instance, a card like Sponsors costs 9mc (including card cost) and will have given 8mc back in gen 5, 10mc in gen 6. A lot of other cards also become unplayable. If you take production and engine strategy out of the game, the game, as a whole, is less fun.\n\nMost players I know will not play 5 player games for that reason. Instead we try to find 1 more person for 2 3p games, or 1 person drops out. (Although the larger Amazonis Planitia map can fix that)\n\nAnyway, World Government Advisor is likely ok in a 3 or 2 player game, turning it into what feels like almost a 4 or 3 player game if used.\n\nIt can also be ok in a Venus gane where people opted to play without the Earth Government Terraforming step. Although in that case they’re getting it anyway in the form of the World Government Advisor prelude, even though they voted against it.\n\nIn any case, the player with this prelude gets a solo decision to change the game. People choose corporations and preludes based on player count. This prelude can be an auto loss for someone who planned an engine strategy.",

Personally, I prefer to play without it, but I think it's fine if everyone agrees.\n\nWith this prelude, you can turn it into a WGT game with your opponents not knowing it when selecting their starting hands, which feels kind of unfair.\n\nThe prelude doesn't provide much quantified value, but it can be of great strategic help to a hardcore rush setup.",

            "body": "I actually don’t like this Prelude and that’s pretty rare. I’m considering taking it out of my Prelude deck. The action is too influencial and can end the game early.\n\nWith 2TR, 1 card and an Earth tag, this Prelude is not a bad pick, especially if you have Earth tag synergy and are planning to TR rush. It gets picked often. In my experience, even people who don’t TR rush tend to use the ability, maybe for Venus, maybe for an ocean to gain adjacency mc next turn, maybe to play a global requirement card.\n\nIf the ability is used every turn, including gen 1, it’s like an extra player is playing. And that can ruin a game. For instance, a 4 player game will be over in gen 6 instead of 7 or 8, and a 5 player game will be over in gen 5 instead of 6. Leaving production useless and engine with no chance.\n\nLast game I played with this was an all expansion 3 player game with the World Government Terraforming step (the normal rule with Venus and good in 3p.) However, thanks to World Goverment Advisor, it ended in generation 7 (instead of 8) with Venus maxed out even, and the game was ruined by ending early according to all 3 players.\n\nThe Global Parameter raising is too influencial. It’s like the Earth Goverment Terraforming step from Venus, but it starts in gen 1 instead of between gen 1 and 2, so it speeds the game up even more. The action should’ve been limited to ~3 resources you can spend on 3 steps. Or ~3 steps during the prelude phase.\n\nhttps://terraforming-mars.herokuapp.com/cards#World%20Government%20Advisor~trbgpcseCmalt",

But the game ended a generation sooner than everyone, including the World Government Advisor player, expected. Therefore the win was unexciting and didn’t feel 100% deserved. As if the game was ended by a “time up” 1 generation before the end.\n\nCards breaking expectations can be a good thing. One player taking out 7 or 8 Global TR from the 42 availabe Global TR isn’t a good thing, at least not in 4 player. That leaves only 35TR for the players and changes the game significantly, potentially making it too short. Like a 5 player game.\n\nThere are other cards with strong game changing effects. Like Nirgal, that can fund 3 Awards in generation 1 for 0mc, removing a lot of players choice. The flipside is that Nirgal is a tough to play low value corporation. World Government Advisor is not a weak prelude.",

Sure it's not worth 5 sp oceans but with a few preludes and events putting down oceans early I wouldn't hesitate to sp an ocean to make this playable. Hell. In the top 100 on steam it's not uncommon to sp two with placement bonuses and use the plants for another set of placement bonuses. \n\nSo this is an excellent card with prelude.

That means, 2, maybe 3, oceans per player, on average.\n\nStandard Project Ocean is 18mc. 15mc with standard tech. Average cost per ocean on cards is (a bit under) 14mc.\n\nIf you play Aquifer Pumping in gen 1, the first ocean is 18+3+8=29mc, mostly in steel.\n\n2 oceans by gen 2 is 18.5mc per ocean\n\nBy gen 3, it’s 15mc spent per ocean.\n\nBy gen 4, chances are oceans are gone, but if it’s 3 or 2 player, and no prelude oceans, and you can play a 4th, it’s 13.25mc per ocean.\n\nIn gen 5, it’s 12.2 per ocean, which is pretty good, but it’s also a scenario where for some reason you played over 50% of all oceans.\n\nSo, if you think you can play 4 or 5 oceans with this, for instance in a 2 player game where you have Lakefront Resorts and Arctic Algae, this can get you oceans for a good price. But there’s still the issue of paying 29mc in gen 1 for only 1TR and a placement bonus. That’s a lot of money for little income, and can cripple your economy/engine.\n\nIt’s possible to come up with rare scenarios where Aquifer Pumping is good. For instance Interplanetary Cinematics (pile of steel) + Merger and Lakefront Resorts (income) or Viron (2 oceans per generation) + Mineral Deposit.\n\nCheung Shing Mars + Advanced Alloys or Rego Plastics can also be decent. You pay 11 or 12mc for the Alloys card, but then -if you have a lot of steel from preludes or cards- your first ocean is 21mc, 2 oceans is 13.5 per ocean, 3 is 11 per ocean, 4 is 9.75 per ocean, and 5 is only 9 per ocean.\n\nAquifer Pumping is a bit better on Amazonis Planitia where there are 11 oceans.

If it gives you one extra greenery then it is already fine, with two or more it is excellent.\n\nGreat thing is that you can dodge a lot of plant hate if you have some small plant amount, then buy ocean, place it for 2 plants, get 2 extra plants and buy immediately a greenery from it. This effect is a huge bonus if you have e.g. just 1 plant prod and need to wait a lot before being able to place greeneries.\n\nThe card has its problems though - late game it is dead, if oceans are placed before you play it the effect diminishes drastically and if you can't spend the plants fast enough, the opponents might just destroy them.",

You can place it on a spot with printed placement bonus and/or 4 or even 6mc ocean adjacency bonus. Or place it near your own cities so you can get adjacency bonus with your greeneries. Or place it next to, or even between, you opponents cities, denying them points.\n\nIt’s an important card on Elysium, where Estate Dealer is often sponsored (most tiles next to ocean).

            "body": "I think my first post didn’t convey very well that I think it’s a decent card. It’s very useful, it combines 2 things you often want, and the alternative production is entirely optional so that’s nothing but a bonus. The downsides are; power production is not the cheapest in town (and you can’t pay in steel), if you don’t need the science tag. And the science tag is expensive if you don’t need the production.\n\nA science tag is worth 2 or 2.5 in quantified value, while the other tags are worth ~1 each. But in actual games, the science tag can be useless for a lot of players, and the building/power tags can be great or useless. If Builder or Contractor are on the map, the building tag is worth a lot more. The two tags are great if Diversifier is on the map. There are also a bunch of good cards in the deck that require 1 or 2 power tags.\n\nPower plant only gives 1 energy production. But in most cases, that’s what you need in order to play another card. It’s different if playing with Colonies of course, where you want 3 power production.\n\nAll cards are different, so comparisons are never “fair”. You need mc to play Artificial Photosynthesis, since steel is not an option. You need 2 cards for the 2 card play that gives you 5 tags. And you need oceans in play for Great Dam.\n\nYou can play different combinations of two small power cards. For instance Power Plant and Fueled Generators or Power Supply Consortium.\n\nAnd if we’re comparing: if it’s midgame and you need 1 more science tag and/or power production and already have 4 science/wild tags: Quantum Extractor is only 1mc more and gives 4(!) energy production, the science tag, and a space discount. Corona Extractor is 2mc cheaper than Artificial Photosynthesis and gives 4 energy production. And Mass Converter is 4mc cheaper and gives 6 energy production.\n\n2 Titanium is not 6 mc, but early game it’s almost as good, since it’s unlikely you can’t spend it, and it can even be worth 8 mc or 10 mc with card effects. You can also trade with titanium.",

It's very strong, for 13mc + 3mc you get a point and a Jovian tag, and a (pretty cheap) Titanium Production. And, very importantly, you get to lower an opponents Titanium production 1 step.\n\nThis can severely limit an opponents chance of winning when played early. Can severely hinder strong corporations like Saturn Systems or Point Luna, that start with 1 Titanium production. (Or help increase your chances if you happen to start with a titanium production corp and this card.) Also relevant for Utopia invest and Robinson Industries.Makes playing 1 Prelude with 1 Titanium production (like Orbital Construction yard) risky. Destroys the unfortunate player that picked Phobolog and a Titanium production prelude.\n\nMost \"take that\" cards are pretty bad or average, and only relevant in 2 player games. In 4 player they see use to slow down the (assumed) leader, or someone with a very strong start. Or late game, to swing a milestone.  \nBut Asteroid Mining Consortium is so good (played early game for the Titanium production or late game for the Jovian tag) that people play it just for the positive effects, and the lowering titanium is sometimes a side effect. Meaning it almost always gets played (if it isn't hate drafted), and sometimes targets the player that is in last place. Therefor it's one of the least liked card and quoted to \"make the game less fun\".",

Which can mean 7 titanium in a 8 gen game if played in gen 1. That’s 21mc in value, and 28mc for Phobolog.\n\nIt’s better in lower player counts, because there are more generations, thus more titanium production.

I don't really agree with that choice, but most cards in the game have 0 cost from the space tag. Earth tags are also traditionally either free or dirt cheap, usually worth 0-1. The two titanium you get in the first round was factored in; the titanium for the second generation would be the one you'd get from placing an asteroid on it in the first round normally.\n\n> Let's put it this way: suppose I have an Adapted Titanium Mine, costs 10, has no tags, gives -1MC production, +1 Titanium production, and 2 Titanium instantly.

Recurring them with this card might not be the most efficient play, but you still hit the opponent more that you hit yourself and it might very easily delay some bigger plays that the opponent planned to do.\n\nYou can also get some cards that give negative points back to hand. Like Bribed Comitee... the possibilities are pretty large.\n\nAlso if you have some event cards synergies, then the efficiency of this goes up by a ton.\n\nOverall the card is mostly great in 1v1, where all the interaction cards can be re-used vs one opponent only. In more players where Virus-ing somebody is not so strong it is a bit more situational, but there are still good targets that make the card worth it. And it also has science tag!",

Big hitters like NRA, GIA and Imported nitrogen can be great too, but are generally on the expensive side. \n\n\n\nThe funniest is to pick up law suit.",

Most players (can) get 3 science tags before game end.\n\nIt's priced at 10mc + 3mc card cost = 13mc.\n\nCompared with Technology Demonstration (5+3= 8mc) it gives 2 permament tags (tech. demonstartion is a science event) ánd 2 VP more for only 5mc more.  \nCompared with Martian Survey (9+3= 12mc) it gives 2 permament tags (tech. demonstartion is a science event) ánd 1 VP more for only 1mc more.  \nThese two event cards are very playable, meaning that Atalanta Planitia is excelltent value.\n\nCompared with Research (11+3= 14mc) it gives a Venus tag ánd a point instead of another science tag, for 1 mc less (!)  \nCompared with Solarnet (7+3= 10mc) it gives a Venus and a science tag, ánd 1 more point for only 3 mc more.  \nThese cards are also considered pretty good, again showing that Atalanta Planitia has excelent value for money.\n\nThe Venus tag is very useful for the Venuphile Award, and the Diversifier Milestone, and a lot of cards in play count or require Venus tags. The Science tag is of course also really useful, for the Scientist Award, Diversifier Milestone, and as a requirement cost for many strong cards.  \nBoth tags are also very useful in turmoil, for when Unity or Scientists become ruling.\n\nThe only times when this card isn't useful is when it's late game and you only have one, or none, science tags. Or, if you're terraforming and can and want to end the game this generation. Or, if you already have a lot of card draw (AI Central) and a hand full of cards, and a better way to gain VP for mc than 2VP for 13mc.",

Especially good if you’re playing with Colonies.\nThis card recently helped me a lot in a game, it let me trade early, and provided a lot of titanium when I had my energy production up, in a 9 generation all expansion game.\n\nYou pay 15 + 3mc card cost = 18mc for something that gives titanium, energy, or heat; whatever you need.\n\nThe 2 titanium is worth 6mc in space cards, or even 8mc if you’re Phobolog or have Advanced/Mercurian Alloys. The 3 energy is potentially worth 9mc if you can trade with it. The 4 heat is half a Temperature step, so ~5 in value.\n\nIn terms of value for money, you can see this as 1 titanium production, that gives 2 titanium cashback, and 1 extra titanium on its first production. (You get 2Ti the gen you play it, 2Ti the next gen, then 0 (you need to place a floater), then 2Ti again, which evens out to 1Ti/generation.) Since you quickly get 3 titanium back, you pay 18 - 9mc in titanium = 9mc for 1 titanium production. Which is good value for money.\n\nThe real value of course is in its versatility. And if you have a source of floaters, turning them into 2 titanium (or energy/heat).\n\nThe no tag means you can’t pay for this in steel or titanium, like most titanium production cards. But you do get 4mc if you’re Sagitta, and 1mc production with Community Services. There’s also the Administrator Award for most cards with no tags.",

It's hard not to compare Bribed Committee to Sponsors, which costs 1 less and lets you keep the earth tag in play!\n\nBribed Committee can shine in the right scenario. If there's a race for Terraformer milestone or Benefactor award, for example. If you are playing as UNMI and need a way to increase TR for your ability. If you have a TR requirement for playing a card maybe. But these scenarios really don't come up in most games. \n\nOverall, a fairly lackluster card and a low draft priority in most games.

It’s usually bad to play this in gen 1 or 2, when you need to focus on income, TR and/or milestones. However, mid game or late game, if you need cards, this can be your best option. And if you got tjis as a free draw, or with the right discounts and rebates, it can become a good play.\n\nDiscounts/rebates: Media group 3mc, Interplanetary Cinematics 2mc, Solar Logistics 1 card, Spire 2mc, Earth Office 3mc, Teractor 3mc, Point Luna 1 card.\n\nAs for value, you can look at it like this: You gain seeing 4 cards, and keeping 2 of them. That gives a lot of options. But you also lose 10mc. That takes away options. Normally you buy up to 4 cards from 4 cards you’re dealt, or that you drafted from up to 10 cards, at 3mc per card. Without discounts, the 2 cards from Business Contacts are 5mc per card. Let’s say you draw 1 useless, 2 mediocre and 1 good card with Business Contacts. You keep the good card and a mediocre one. You now payed 5mc for each, instead of 3mc for “normal” cards meaning you payed 2mc extra per card. (Of course, if you’re out of cards this can be worth it, considering that Standard Projects cost 4mc more per project than their average cost.)\n\nBusiness Contacts is better in non draft games. It’s like seeing a freshly drawn hand and buying 2. With draft you see 7 (2 player), 9 (3 player) or 10 (4+ player) cards each round, so the quality (relevance to your strategy) of the 4 cards you draft is higher (on average) than 4 random cards. This goes for all card draw; it’s more important in lower player count, and especially if you play non draft. But card draw is still very important in 4p draft.\n\nBusiness Contacts becomes more interesting if the Legend Milestone is in play (5 event cards played, 4 with M&A).",

And last week the Jovian collector came in a close second place, again with 2 multipliers.\n\nLast month I had a conversation with the winner of a large tournament, and also 2 people who placed in the top 10, and they all said that the Jovian Multipliers are among the highest priority cards to hatedraft. And that's in 4 player base+prelude. In longer games, so 2-player and 3-player, or games with expansions added, they're even stronger.\n\nAbout a year or so ago I had a game where I started with two multipliers, got another one early and was given one in draft. So I got to play all four, and a couple of other Jovian cards. I don't remember what corporation I was, but I won with a large gap.\n\nSo, that's my experience.

            "body": "Looks like a fun and pretty good card if you’re playing engine and can play this before playing most of your science tags.\n\nIt’s 14 + 3mc card cost = 17mc. You can pay in steel. You get 2 useful tags, and 1VP. The Science tag helps with your science tree. Discount for Vitor, Cheung Shing Mars and Spire.\n\nIt’s very common to play space cards, and sometimes a city card, after your science cards, when playing engine. Spending the graphene shouldn’t be a problem. It’s basically Phobolog Titanium that you can spend on city cards too. Though, like titanium, it’s possible a bit is left after game end.\n\nYou get 2 tags, 1VP and 1 graphene, worth about 11 to 12mc. Meaning you only need to play 2 science tags after this card to turn a profit. Just looking at mc, it’ll about break even after playing 3 more science cards (you’ll have 4 graphene worth 16).\n\nIt’s not uncommon for engine players to reach Anti-gravity, meaning you’ll have 8 science tags. 10+ science tags, in low player counts, with expansions, non Earth Government Terraforming Venus games, or when Scientist is funded, is also not uncommon.\n\nWith 7 extra science cards played you get 32mc to spend on space cards and cities. When you play 9 extra science cards, you get 40mc in graphene. Basically, this card gives a 4mc discount on science tags. Can get crazy if you have card draw, cards saved up for the last generation, and have this combined with Earth Catapult and Anti-gravity.\n\nIf you play this with Vitor, and get to 10 science tags, you get 40mc in graphene and 1VP for only 14mc in steel. That’s great value for money. For a terraformer, like Ecoline, the card is worthless. Be careful passing it in draft early game.",

I think of it as about as good as a 4 mc discount on science tags. There is no warping of your strategy to play low value science tags early in order to reach a tag requirement and start receiving the production, like with mass converter or antigrav. for example if you have breathing filters you can just wait until the last gen to get the 4 mc benefit, instead of sinking cash early on non-production cards. Also, you can roll multiple science tags in a single generation and have big power spikes early.\n\nLast niche benefit, but more cards and awards/milestones are being printed that reference “resources on cards” which would include this one.",

It’s fun to play, but often average in practical value, with some exceptions of course.\n\nIt’s 16 + 3 (card cost) + ~7 (energy production) = 26mc for 4 mc production, placement bonus, a building tag, and hopefully 1 or more VP.\n\nIt’s not a city. You can’t claim Mayor with it. But it can be helpful for Builder, and Banker and Landlord later on.\n\nEarly game, you don’t really want to spend an energy production on an average card. And there are no or few spots between cities yet. 26mc for 4 mc production isn’t great.\n\nEarly Game good but realistic scenario: place it on the titanium+grass area next to an opponents city. Then you get 1 plant and 1 titanium (~5mc) and 1VP.\n\nThat’s 10 in value. If you got an energy production for 7mc, that means you spent 16mc on 4 mc production. That’s decent.\n\nIf you’re Vitor or Cheung Shing, you can get a 3mc or 2mc discount, making this a good play.\n\nBut if you bought the energy production for 11mc (standard project) then it’s not such a good play.\n\nInstead of the plant+titanium space, a 1 or 2 plant space adjacent to an ocean and an opponents city is also a good spot.\n\nMid Game realistic scenario: place it between 2 opponents cities and maybe get a placement bonus.\n\nPlacing it between 2 cities means waiting and getting no choice in placement (bonus). You get 2VP, but the 4 income is worth a lot less. I often see this tile played like this, and it does deny 2 opponents 1 point. But it’s not very good value for money for the one placing it either.\n\nWith experienced players, there’s rarely an open space between 3 tiles. This just invites ANY sort of special tile. However, it can occur, and if you can get 3VP, then Commercial district is very decent mid game.\n\nLate game: it’s not uncommon at all to have a pile of leftover steel. And energy production is worthless in the last gen or the gen before it. That, along with discount effects, can make this card cheap to play, or even “free” if you don’t have other building cards with points or a city. The mc production on this card is worthless now, but the 1VP or 2VP is still good. And it can deny (an) opponent(s) 1 VP is some cases.\n\nIts main use late game is for Awards. 4mc can swing Banker. It’s a tile for Landlord. And in the battle for most tiles adjacent to oceans it can be very useful, since it’s a special tile, you can place it anywhere, including that last far away spot next to an ocean on Elysium. Forget the 1 or 2 city VPs, get a 5VP award with it.",

Those are not tough requirements to satisfy. \n\nSince VP in the early game is normally not worth worrying about, if you can satisfy the reqs for Conscription and play it early, it will provide you with a nice boost. 8 net money can be a huge help early on. In the mid game, it drops off a bit since 8 money isn't as good. But still worth it. Depending on what options you have, even playing it late game can also be worth it.\n\nWith synergies, it becomes much better too. IC corp and Media Group give extra money for playing events making it more efficient. The Legend milestone or Point Luna or Terractor will all gives other reasons to play it.\n\nOverall, Conscription is a great card and a medium to high draft priority depending on the game.

However, there are better options such as Ants to get 1VP every 2 microbes, or one of the cards that lets you spend microbes for Terraforming.\n\nIf you have a microbe giving card such as Extreme Cold Fungus, again, Decomposers can be a decent target for that, but you'd rather put it on a more efficient microbe target if available.\n\nOverall, Decomposers is a low draft priority and low impact card in most games.

Symbol (Vitor) is explicitly excluded (if you read the rule leaflet carefully).",

If you try to play this early, you're either using almost all of your starting cash on a high starting cash Corp, or you're saving up cash across generations to be able to afford it. Having titanium can supplement some of the cost, but it's very rare that you can even pay half of it with metal. Notable exception would be if you are playing as Phobolog and use your starting metal on it.\n\nSo what do you get for the fattest card in the game? 3 titanium production is worth about 9MC production. In games where you don't get enough space tags, it can be worth slightly less, but in games where you get advanced alloys, Mercurian alloys, or Phobolog, it can be worth more. In most games, you would be profiting in 5 gens. That's slightly below curve for most decent economy cards. And for such a large investment, you'd want it to be well ahead of average. But it's also worth 4VP. Once you take that into account, it becomes an efficient card. However, it also becomes an awkward card to play. \n\nToo early in the game and you'd prefer better economy cards. VP doesn't matter yet. Too late in the game, and you'd prefer cards that give better VP for the money spent, as the production no longer matters.\n\nSo this is best played midgame, when both production and VP matter. This makes it better with lower player counts where there is more midgame. It's also better with Triton available, as the extra titanium will surely help you get this card out. \n\nOverall, if you have a good situation for it, this can be a powerful card that even turns the tide from losing to winning to whoever played it. This makes it a high draft priority in those situations. But in many cases it will be too award and costly and won't be worth playing. A well designed card imo.",

I make 32 MC\n- I just buy the missing energy: 2+4+6 = 12 MC\n- 20 MC is profit, while the card cost like 6.\n\nAnd with more surpluss energy it gives even more.\n\nThe card is a bit situational, but is very good, paradoxically, when paired with good energy prod cards. It can turn energy producing cards into (almost) free points or whatever their upside on top of energy prod is.\n\nSituational buying energy for colony trading etc. is a bit expensive, but it is also possible and adds to the flexibility of the card.",

            "body": "Energy market is 3+3 to draft and play, which makes it a tiny investment. But for that investment? You get a powerful and flexible card that can profit you in multiple ways.\n\nEven played in the last gen, if you have any energy production you'll be sure to profit 2 MC after the 8 MC gained overpays for the 6 you spent to play Energy Market. If played before the last gen, Energy Market is far more powerful though. One of the weaker uses of energy market is to amass energy that becomes heat next gen for raising the temp. If you only need 1-3 more heat to make that happen, it's pretty nice and can help you be competitive towards the temp track bonuses, especially that free ocean.\n\nA stronger use of Energy Market would be to supply energy for trading if playing with Colonies or to supply energy for cards that use it such as Martian Rails, Bio Printing Facility, Physics Complex, and the oxygen pumpers such as Ore Processor. A hidden strength of Energy Market is the flexibility to play any and all of these energy users. You don't have to pick and choose based on your energy supply anymore, you can just hoard them all.\n\nAnd if you already make more energy than you need? Well then the profit is more direct. Turn that extra energy into cash, especially after the temp gets high and you don't need the heat anymore. But honestly, it's likely better to have 8 money than a delayed heat production, if that's what your extra energy is destined for, so it's still strong to convert extra energy into cash while the heat is low. For the doubters of this strategy, just think about how bad the card Micro-Mills is... and see that \\*not\\* converting your extra energy to 8 money is like playing a WORSE Micro-Mills.\n\nPerhaps the worst case for Energy Market is when you have exactly as much energy as you need. But it still could come in handy later in the game if you find more energy production or energy consumption cards, and remember it's always at least 2 profit from the last gen.\n\nOverall, Energy Market is a very versatile and powerful card at a tiny cost. I would place it as a solidly high priority to draft in most games. And if Colonies are involved? That goes up to top priority a lot of the time. You might not need the Energy now, but you might later and you certainly don't want that flexibility falling into the wrong hands!",

You can go for the Hoverlord Milestone, which is always in the game when playing with Venus, and claim it in turn 2 gen 2 with 7 floaters. Then with the action get 1 Venus TR in gen 3 through 9. That’s 7TR in a 9 gen game, or 7VP and 21mc back. And the 5VP Milestone.\n\nThe Venus tag also counts for the Venuphile Award, which can be claimed in every Venus game.\n\nThe card is also better of course if Titan is in play.\n\nThe card is a lot more interesting in you have Stratospheric Birds in hand. Or Sulphur Eating Bacteria. Less interesting if other players have those cards ;)\n\nAlso helps with the Milestones Planetologist, Sponsor, Trader, and the Awards Celebrity and Collector. (It’s one of the cheapest 20mc+ cards.)",

The microbe cards only get to 2TR in gen 5, 6 or 7!\n\nIt also gives you a shot at Hoverlord. And Ants don’t eat floaters.\n\nI did the math (if played in gen 1), and in a vacuum (no other cards) Balloons is better than all microbe cards except Nitrate Reducing Bacteria. Nitrate starts being value for money in gen 6, and becomes good if the game reaches gen 9. Balloons has about the same numbers. GHG and Thermophiles need gen 7 to be considered value for money and gen 10 to be actually worth it (I calculated with them being played in gen 2 dye to requirements). Regolith Eaters never becomes value for money, unless you can still do an oxygen gen 9.\n\nWith Floater Technology (+10mc) or Symbiotic Fungus (+7mc) both Balloons and all microbe cards (if played gen 1) become value for money in gen 6. All become really worth it if the game reaches gen 8. Balloons reaches the most profit (VP and income minus cost of cards) followed by Nitrite, then GHG, then Thermophiles. Regolith Eaters is in the middle and depends on if you can take 5 oxygen by gen 8. Since there’s only 14 oxygen TR, that’s likely a no in a 4p game.\n\nOnly with Extreme Cold Fungus (+16mc) are the microbe cards better. They still need gen 6 to become value for money, but turn really profitable in gen 7 (+18mc!). Except Regolith Eaters, that one only pays off if the other player(s) let you take 7 oxygen in 7 gens.\n\nTL;DR Balloons is actually better than the microbe cards, unless you have Extreme Cold Fungus. (and of course Titan or Enceladus change the gane too.)",

Economically speaking, you are likely to never break even. At 5 gens out from playing Extractor Balloons, you've gained 8 money from the TR and 3 VP. If you value VP at 5 each, this could be said to be a total value of 23, still short of the 24 you spent on it, and you've had to spend 15 on VP 5+ gens before the last gen, which is usually a bad call strategically.\n\nWith Floater Technology, Titan Colony, or other floater synergies, you can make Extractor Balloons far more effective. However, even with the best synergies, you're capped at gaining 1 TR per gen. And you've got to be filling it with at least two floaters a gen to maintain that rate. It's still quite the hefty cost to get going.\n\nOverall, a skippable card in most games. With great synergy, it can rise to be a playable, maybe even good card.

In total that’s 35-41mc.\n\nSo paying 29+3=32mc, in steel, for it is good value for money. Thanks to the builder and power tag, you might also get discounts.\n\nLate game it’s also good, if you have excess money or steel (there aren’t many late game steel dumps in the game), you can build a city and get 1 to 3VP and/or a tile related Award. Compared to SP city, this is 7mc more expensive, but it gives 3 plants to balance that. Might be just what you need to place a final Greenery.\n\nCompared to a good base game city like Cupola, if you balance the power production on both cards with -7mc and +7mc, then Cupola is 23mc and Field-Capped is 22mc. Cupola gives 1 more mc production, but field capped gives 3 plants and a power tag.",

That means that you're choosing that over Luna, Ceres, Triton, Pluto, etc. There's not many scenarios where you can convince me it's correct to colonize titan over those colonies. \n\nThere's also just 17 floater cards out of 371 cards so already this is a niche strategy as it's far from guaranteed that you get those floater cards early. But remember that most floater cards want to use their action early to get a benefit. So you're really looking for Titan Shuttles and Dirigibles so it's 2 cards out of 371 cards. You commented about the milestone, but I think it's a trap to play a card like forced precipitation (8+3MC) then colonize Titan (17MC) use the action (2MC), then trade again, then claim the milestone. You've spent 38MC and 2 of your valuable trades to get 4 Venus TR over 5 generations and 5VP. It's too much money invested early on for points instead of your engine. But to add insult to injury, Floater leasing is still only worth 2 MC prod after that. You'd have to use forced precipitation again for the floater for it to be worth 3MC prod at which point, you're trading TR for MC which is a strictly worse trade.\n\nSo your comment is saying, \"Well, if you happen to find floater cards early, specifically the 2 good ones, there are no good colonies outside of Titan, and then you trade there every gen, and get floater leasing, then it's good! Which is true, but incredibly unlikely. I don't base my evaluation of how good a card is on the best case scenario like that.",

The fact that you have to pay for the floater is a bit annoying, but the low cost of the card makes up for it.\n\nJovian lanterns, the other card with a 1 for 2 VP floater ratio, also makes you pay to put floaters, but it only goes on itself, and part of its payoff is the two free floaters and the TR you get.

But if you can't add more floaters to this, then it is just way too slow.\n\nSo if I have no other floater placers, then this is almost unplayable.

All it needs is an entry fee of 15MC and 3 rounds!\n\nJokes aside, this card is terrible.\n\nAt a starting cost of 11 (8+3), the expected return on investment should be ~2.75 value per round. Venus stages are valued at around 11MC officially, and it takes 3 rounds per one of those, plus 4MC. That means you are using ~12MC in effort for 11 in official value. That's a poor RoI already, especially for something that requires 3 rounds to get *any* value from and 6 to turn a profit. But to make things worse, Venus' official evaluation is overvalued, and a Venus step is only marginally better than a TR, and TR itself is overvalued. I'd place a venus step at around 8 or 9 value. So you are paying 12 for 8 or 9 value. That's really bad RoI.\n\nIt gets marginally better with floater synergies, but it's rarely particularly great, even in the ideal situation.",

This means the TR makes little money back. The 13mc you need to pay in gen 1 is really bad for your economy. Basically you’re paying for VP in gen 1, and the income is late and very little.\n\nIf you do the math; Forced Precipitation:\n\nGen 8: 2VP for 19mc, you earn 7mc back, net cost 12mc.\n\nGen 9: 3VP for 23mc, you earn 9mc back, net cost 14mc.\n\nCompare to just getting the 3 Venus TR in gen 1 with Giant Solar Shade:\n\nGen 8: 3VP for 30mc, you earn 21mc back, net cost 9mc.\n\nGen 9: 3VP for 30mc, you earn 24mc back, net cost 6mc.\n\nExtractor Balloons is even better:\n\nGen 8: 3VP for 24mc, you earn 14mc back, net cost 10mc.\n\nGen 9: 4VP for 24mc, you earn 17mc back, net cost 7mc.\n\nOr Jet Stream Microscrappers:\n\nGen 8: 4VP for 27mc, you earn 12mc back, net cost 15mc.\n\nGen 9: 4VP for 27mc, you earn 16mc back, net cost 11mc.\n\nForced Precipitation is the same as Thermophiles, but without the requirement (Venus 3 steps) and the microbes are free vs paying 2mc for a floater. Thermophiles:\n\nGen 8: 2VP for 12mc, you earn 7mc back, net cost 5mc.\n\nGen 9: 3VP for 12mc, you earn 9mc back, net cost 3mc.\n\nThermophiles played in gen 3 is still better than Forced Precipitation played in gen 1. Getting 2VP for net cost 9mc.\n\nSo, Forced Precipitation is worse than Giant Solar Shade, Spin Inducing Asteroid, Extractor Balloons, Jet Stream Microscrappers, Thermophiles etc.\n\nOf course, if played early, it’s better than Standard Project Venus, but it isn’t better than SP Venus + Standard Technology.

With a requirement of 10% Venus AND a soft requirement of having a Venus animal or Venus microbe card out to use the full ability, this card is a great example of the issue of expansion dilution. \n\nExpansion dilution happens when you play too many expansions and the card pool gets diluted. So you may never see a Venus animal or microbe card. There really aren't that many of them. And the game might not see enough good cards that increase the Venus %. So many games may never see Freyja Biodomes played even if it comes up.\n\nIf you have Sulfur Eating Bacteria or Venusian Animals out, Freyja Biodomes is absolutely worth it. It's a good rate for end of game VP. With SEB, it would be 11 for 2 VP or with VA it would be 17 for 4 VP. Probably not worth playing earlier than the last gen if you might need the energy production or if you just have more important things to play.\n\nBut the situation is so niche that you can't say this card is good. Even if playing with Venus Next as your only expansion, it's still not going to be super common that you get one of the few Venus animal or microbe cards that make it worth it. Not all of them are good.\n\nOverall, a niche card that is decent with the perfect situation, but most games it's very skippable.

And if Mars First is in power, you get a steel from placing the city.\n\nHellas is less interesting, but it does have the spot that let’s you place 3 oceans for 18mc. You can pay the 18mc after getting mc from ocean adjacency. You’re also 1/3 Polar Explorer, and the 2 titanium ocean spot might still be open. Great if you’re Lakefront Resorts and/or have Arctic Algae! If Mars First is in power you get 4 steel too.\n\nUtopia has a 6 cards + 3 titanium spot. And also a 6 titanium spot, and a 3 titanium + 3 steel spot. And 3 spots for 3 ocean adjacency.\n\nTerra Cimmeria has a crazy spot that lets you place 3 colonies for 15mc! (cheaper than 1 colony SP price.) It also has a 6 cards spot, 6 titanium spot, 6 steel + 3 titanium and 6 steel + 3 plants spot.\n\nVastitas has the 3 Temperature for 12mc(!) spot. And 2 6 card spots, 1 6 titanium spot, and 2 3 delegates spots (which can secure you chairman and a party of choice).\n\nAmazonis Planitia has the 6 cards spot, a very nice 9 plants spot, and the craziest of all is of course Olympus Mons which gives you 6 delegates! (Imagine playing that when you have Septem Tribus and Viron.)\n\nTharsis (base game) is maybe the least interesting map. But you do get 6 plants and 1/3 to Mayor. Later in the game it has a few spots that might get triple ocean adjacency. Talking about Tharsis; that corporation really like Frontier Town.",

I remembered this card could be crazy, but only with 1 or 2 spots per map, because it does not triple ocean adjacency.

I even looked up a photo of Frontier Town, but somehow missed “PRINTED” even though it’s all caps.\n\nI’m pretty sure you’re right about the delegates. Although it feels a bit off; delegates are not resources (bronze, silver and gold cubes), but they’re actions you can do, like trading with a colony, doing a Standard Project, or buying the scientists policy. 2 delegate icons could just as well mean doing the “place a delegate” action twice.\n\nHowever, 2 delegate icons are also on Cultural Metropolis, Jovian Envoys, Venus Envoy, and High Cirles, and on those cards the reminder text says to place both in 1 party.\n\nRise to Power gives you 3 delegate icons, but with an asterisk, and caps text telling you they can be in seperate parties.\n\nSponsoring Nation, like the spot on Amazonis Planitia, just gives you 2 delegate icons. No reminder text.\n\nThe 4 cards with reminder text, and the card with the asterisk, strongly suggest that all double delegate icons go to one party, making this card not so great for Septem Tribus.",

Like the trade fleet from a card effect. Except the trade fleet goes to the trade fleet tile, and delegates go to a delegate area.\n\nThere’s something about choosing just 1 opponent (target) when dealing with red bordered resources in the rulebook. But gaining special resources to just 1 target card is a ruling on a forum, not in the rulebook.\n\nDelegates are different from special resources though. They don’t have a target card. They go to the delegate area. And as most cards suggest, and fryx confirms, 2 delegates from the same card or placement bonus, need to go to the same party (unless otherwise specified with an asterisk.) I think omitting the explanation text on Sponsoring Nation was just an oversight.\n\nIf there was a card (like a fanmade prelude) that gave 2 colonies, that’d mean they would have to go to the same colony, like 2 delegates that go to the same party.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking the 6 delegates spot isn’t THAT bad for Septum Tribus, after all, in gen 1 Septum Tribus has low start mc, and getting 8mc from delegates in 4 parties isn’t bad. And gen 1 is the gen when the 2 delegate spot (worth 10mc) might still be open. BUT then it occured to me that you need to have 2 delegates in Mars First in order to play Frontier Town. Leaving only 5 delegates free, and Frontier Town unplayable on the 6 delegates spot for ANY corporation. The only way to play Frontier Town there is if Mars First is in power in gen 2 or later, and you have 1 or less delegates in the delegate area.",

Ecotec and Splice (and Viral Enhancers) get a nice start microbe, and splice can even get 2 or 4mc. Aridor can get some nice income from the tags.\n\nThe microbe tag is relevant for the Ecologist and Diversifier Milestone, and the Science tag for Researcher (4 science tags) and the Scientist Award. GHG Bacteria is also great for Tactician (4 cards with requirement) and the Forecaster and Excentric Awards.\n\nThe microbe tag can also be nice for cards like Worms, and the Science tag is of course important for science tag requirements, and your science tree if playing engine.\n\n4% oxygen requirement means that you can sometimes, but not always, play this in gen 1 or 2 in a 4 player base+prelude game. In a 2 player or non prelude game, it’s much harder to play early.\n\nGHG Bacteria’s main attraction is of course raising Temperature with microbes. On its own it can do this every 3 generations. Meaning you can get 2 Temperature TR out of it if played in gen 2 or 3 in a 4 player game (usually 7 or 8 gens), making it decent value for money. However, if your 4 player game ends in gen 6 or 7, or if Temperature is maxed in the last generation before it’s your turn, you might get only 1TR out of it, which isn’t great value for money.\n\nA microbe dispender card can crank the GHG bacteria up to 1 Temperature every 2 generations. And the combo with Extreme/cold Fungus can charge it to 1 Temperature every generation. Making it good/great value for money, if played early enough. It has to fit your strategy though. Basically this is a terraforming engine card. But if you need Temperature (as Ecoline or Tharsis) and it’s lagging, this can be good.\n\nWithout Extreme-cold Fungus the GHG Bacteria can still be very good if Enceladus is in play, especially if you have a colony track boosting card. Or you can use specific asteroids/events to add microbes. Great with Topsoil Contract. Beware of Ants.",

This card is best played late game, with discounts, and hopefullu in titanium.\n\nIt also has a Jovian tag, which works for Saturn Systems, and the Rim Settler milestone (3 Jovian tags). Rim Settler needs Jovians so it’s better than Mayor.\n\nAs for the multiplier; you can easily win a game with Jovians if you have 3 or 4 multipliers. Which isn’t very common, but it can happen if you have 1 or 2 in your starting hand, and people don’t know about your strategy and give them to you.

It is *the* best card for raising Venus (well maybe [Spin-Inducing Asteroid](https://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#246) is better overall), so it can almost single-handedly enable you to reach the requirements of the best Venus cards in a game where no-one else is interested in raising Venus. Without cards like these, it would be just too costly to raise the Venus all by yourself, so having these kind of enabler cards is really nice for those situations. And the best Venus cards have such a good scoring potential, that it can be simply game winning to get them online (relatively early) in a game where they are good.\n\nIn all expansions play the cost is actually often not too bad, since there are a lot of synergistic combinations that can enable you to play this card much cheaper than the hefty 27mc cost. Especially the space tag helps in this regard. [Triton colony](https://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#TRITON), Unity policy, [Dust Laser Mining](https://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#X01), [Mercurian Alloys](https://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#X07), and [Warp Drive](https://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#C49) are just some examples of cards that help you get heaps of titanium, boost the worth of titanium, or just straight up give you discount on the Space cards in all expansions play.

Early middle game is exactly when you want energy production to play certain cards or trade with colonies.\n\nThe Big Box promo version is even better. For only 3mc more you get to place a special tile next to an ocean. (The 3D tile looks great too.) You get 2 or 4mc, possibly more, ocean adjacency bonus, plus the printed bonus, so the tile is almost always worth 3mc or more.

The Greenery is worth at least 2VP if placed next to your city, and a placement bonus.\n\nSometimes it’s played middle game, for instance if it gives you 5 or 6 plants to get up to 8, so you can secure your plants into a Greenery between 2 of your cities.\n\nOr to get the 8% oxygen Temperature bonus.

With Robotic Workforce or Cyberia Systems, you can copy this production for only 2 energy production.\n\nThis card is stronger in 2 player, since the game will me more generations (of production) and players will have a much larger tableau of cards (more tags). It’s less playable with Colonies, players may want to hang on to their energy production to trade.\n\nOverall this card is a good addition to the deck, there aren’t that many good midgame or late game cards to spend your steel on.",

If you value an early city at 14mc, then you need to get 4mc production from this card for it to be at least average. That means having 4 Earth or Venus tags. Which is pretty hard to get, unless you got a nice combination with your corporation(s) and preludes. Even with 5 or 6 tags, this card is merely ok, not great.\n\nThis card can be played in a base where Venus tags are either ignored, or a base game with Venus tags but without the Venus track (no cards added with the Venus track or Venus track requirements). But most of the time, this card is in games with Venus and Colonies. Lowering your energy production is something you really don’t want in Colonies.\n\nIt has some use for Milestones. You can get Mayor (3 cities) or Sponsor (3 20mc+ cards) with it.\nAnd for milestones, you can get Celebrity or Banker with it. (Late game this can give you 8mc income or more easily).\n\nMidgame this card is still (below) average, but late game, in the last generation or the generation before that, this card can become decent.\n\nMost Building tag cards are good (very) early game. There are few good building cards for late game. Quite often, people have steel resources left over. Energy production often isn’t useful in the last gen or the 1 or 2 gens before that. And sonetimes, science engine players have a lot of it late game.\n\nIn some situations, the best way for someone to get points (the only thing that matters last gen) is to place a city for 2 or 3 VP. This costs 25mc with the standard project.\nGyropolis can be practically free last gen if you happen to have a pile of steel, energy production, and maybe card discount. If you play it 1 generation before the last, you can even enjoy some nice extra income in the last. The extra income from Gyropolis can also help win a tiebreaker.\n\nOverall I really like this card, even if it’s not often good value or useful. With expansions and promos, focus shifted from building cards to space cards. This is one of few large, late game, building cards, to use your steel on.\n\nIt’s slightly better in 2p, because there are more generations (production is worth more) and you have way more tags played midgame and endgame.",

But it’s balanced. You can play Lichen, which gives the same except 1 plant resource less, at -24C, 5 steps sooner, and it only costs 1mc more. Moss can be played for 2mc less and costs a plant instead of getting one, but you can often play it in gen 1 or 2, with the 3 ocean requirement. Grass is 5mc more, gives 2 plants more and can be played 1 temperature step sooner (-16C). Bushes can be played 2 steps later (-10C) for 4mc more but gives an extra plant and an extra plant production.\n\nIt’s good with Ecoline and Arklight, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone and Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems, Robot Pollinators, GMO contract, and of course it’s GREAT with Insects and Nitrogen Rich Asteroid.",

It’s at least 1mc cheaper than the Standard Project Air Scrapping (15mc).\n\nIt can also be worth playing for the TR if you get enough discount, like mc discount on event or space tags (2mc is very common), getting the card for free, and/or increased titanium value (Phobolog, Advanced/Mercurian Alloys). And of course synergy with space events, like Advanced Aerobraking (3mc and 3 heat) or Solar Logistics (1 card).\n\nIF you have Jovian tags, AND you have a Venus card that can hold floaters, the venus floaters can potentially be very valuable. A jovan player can easily have 6 or 8 or more Jovian and Wild tags. That means 6 or even 8+ venus floaters.\n\nWith Dirigibles (11mc) that’s worth 18 or 24+ mc to play a Venus card.\n\nWith Floating Habs (5mc) that’s worth 3 or 4+ VP.\n\nWith Celestic, Stratopolis, or Cloud Tourism it’s worth 2 or 3VP.\n\nThere are only 7 other Venus project cards that can hold floaters.

By the time they're playable, there may not be any oceans left to place.  And even if there are, unless you're first player, they might vanish before your turn when you're that deep into the game.\n\nAnd, honestly speaking, the card's cost efficiency simply isn't high enough.\n\nA standard project aquifer costs 18.\n\nGeneral game value puts an ocean at about 13-14 value (Ice Asteroid is 13/ea with a space tag, Subterranean Reservoir is 14.)  Preludes value it a bit lower, which makes sense due to the point value of raising your TR being lower value gen 1-2.\n\nEven taker the higher value there, and calling it 14 value, this is 8 MC.  8 MC for 14 value feels great.  But 8 MC for 5 value (1 VP) doesn't - and when you're in the final 1-2 rounds of the game, the VP is really all you get.  Unless you can get good placement bonuses, which can improve the value.  You can probably get 2 MC for an ocean adjacency, but typically all the good placements will be gone by 0C.\n\nIf you see this card in the last 1-2 generations and it's playable, it's worth the 3 MC gamble.  The other 95% of the time, it's dead weight.\n\nWould have been much better if it was -6C requirement and +2 MC cost.",

Having colonies out there on the right regions is very important before the spots fill up.

However, it's also an event which can potentially earn you progress toward the Legend milestone or give you rebates from Media Group or other potential benefits. Further, it has a space tag allowing you to spend titanium on it. The earth tag doesn't stick around, but it may be helpful if you have something like Martian Zoo, that gets benefit for playing earth tags.\n\nICS is very efficient and an amazing value with a good situation for it. And even in a subpar situation, it's still saving you money off a colony. The only time you wouldn't want it, is if you already placed all the colonies you'll need for the rest of the game. This puts it at a high draft priority early game, and still a medium priority late game. There are other even better colony placing cards, like Mining Colony or Trading Colony.

You need at least 4 discounts plus 6 titanium spent to *break even*.\n\nAnd again, that's ignoring the science requirements. If it takes 1 out-of-the-way science to play this, that's 6 titanium plus 6 discounts. If it takes 2, that's 4 titanium plus 9 discounts. Which is generally the point at which it becomes generally unfeasible.",

Based on traditional Science tag requirements, 5 tags should make it cost around 10 cheaper instead. So traditional numbering would place this at around 7+3 costs.\n\nBut that’s what’s so weird: despite costing around 17 more than it normally should, the space tag synergizes really well with late game titanium and space discounts, making this card go from bad to very solid. On top of that, it’s the most VP you can get from a single card without that card drawing more cards.\n\nSo it’s an overpriced by heavily optimized card that ends up being a solid lategame effect for the people who already fulfill that requirement.",

            "body": "One of four oxygen bumper cards where, as an action, you pay energy resources to increase oxygen.\n\nThis is the basic one; 11mc, 4 energy -> 1 oxygen and 1 steel.\n\nThere’s also one that’s 4mc more expensive but gives 1 more steel (2mc more) per action, and one (Ore processor) that’s 2mc more expensive and gives 1 titanium (1mc more) per action.\n\nAnd there’s one that’s 12mc, requires 2 oceans, and only 3 energy resources, but doesn’t give metal(s).\n\nhttps://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#177#101#103#104\n\nGetting to 4 energy production early game isn’t very easy or cheap, unless specific preludes do it for you. And then there’s the issue of the oxygen track only having 14 steps. You need to do the action 3 or more times to make the card worth it. And you can only start using it gen 2.\n\nYou also can’t play cards that lower energy production easily when you still need the energy for this card. And you’re a target for one of the two energy production stealing cards.\n\nIn 4 player games with prelude, these cards are often not really worth the trouble. Unless maybe if you can get the Temperature bonus with it. You’re better off with plant production.\n\nIn 2 player, however, there are a few more generations to use the action. The 14 oxygen spots are to be divided over 2 players, instead of 4, that’s a huge difference. And in 2p, you’re the target of about 50% of asteroid cards instead of 25%. These oxygen bump cards can be good in 2 player.\n\nIn 3 player it’s in between, and really depends on other players strategy.\n\nIn 5p these cards are bad, and for solo, they’re great.\n\nWith expansions added, these cards kinda become obsolete, because, somewhere during early/middle game, you’ll want to use 3 energy to trade with a colony.\n\nAs for quantified cost, you pay 5.6 in value for 11.6 in value every gen. And 11 + 3 for the card. That’s +6mc per gen to pay off the 14mc investment.\n\nSo if you get 2 oxygen out of it, it’s bad, unless you get the temperature bonus and/or builder milestone out of it. If you can get 4 or more oxygen out of it, it’s a good play.",

There are quite a few cards that specifically add floaters to Jovian cards, so this is a good recipient for those. By itself it also generates 1VP/gen if you can afford the titanium. Early game that's usually not a good plan, but later on the prospect of paying 3 for a point becomes quite interesting.\n\nOverall I quite like this card. It's decent by itself, and if you have any reason to care more about Jovians or floaters it becomes really good.",

Basically, the 2 steps are worth about 6, 7 or 8mc every time you trade, unless the colonies are very weak. You can even trade twice per generation if you have a second trade fleet, doubling L1 Trade Terminal effects power. Competition from other players on the colony boards is not a big problem; colonies where the marker is low are not worth visiting for other players, but are worth it for you!\n\n6 to 8, potentially even a lot more, extra income, or value in resources, every generation, including the generation you play this card, which can be as early as gen 1 or 2, for only 25mc is a steal. And you can pay in titanium!\n\nVery good with other trading/colony cards like the 3 +1 trade fleets, Cryo-Sleep and Rim Freighters (pay 1 resource less to trade), Trade Envoys and Trading Colony (increase the track 1 step), Venus Trade Hub (3mc), and Poseidon.\n\nYou also get 2VP, which is nice if you are Vitor.\n\nAnd for whatever reason, the designers thought this card also needed 3 free resources to be placed on 3 different cards. Middle and late game this can be very strong. You might have 1VP animal cards, or even a card with 2VP resources. L1 Trade Terminal can be a pretty good last gen 5VP titanium dump.\n\nWith the right prelude and corporation cards, the resources can even be useful in gen 1 or 2, making this card even better:\n\nPharmacy Union can get a resource that can be worth 1TR. Pristar can get a 1VP resource (gen 2), Astrodrill can get an asteroid worth 2 titanium. Ecology Experts can get a 1VP animal into play. You can save the resource for later with Applied Science, or use it with Board of Directors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point",

Also the card draw is much better earlier in the game, late it is just random if the cards will be dead or good.\n\nThat is actually why I have no problem to play this early if I don't have 1VP animals on hand, don't have any better play and have some titanium: grab ocean + plants for a greenery, get greenery tile bonus and cards that will have much lower dead chance.

However, you also need to pay 5 heat.\n\nIn most games, the heat cost really isn't an issue because the thermometer tends to go up faster than the oxygen, so you'll have leftover heat at the end and not much to spend it on.\n\nThe best use for Local Heat Trapping would be putting animals on an animal card that gives 1 VP per animal, such as Predators, Stratospheric Birds, or  others. This gives 2 VP for only 4 MC and 5 heat. A fantastic rate. It's still likely worth using without any animal cards for the plants. 4MC and 5 heat for half of a greenery is still really efficient!\n\nOf course any event synergy such as Media Group, Interplanetary Cinematics, or Legend Milestone will make cheap event cards gain even more value.\n\nOverall, Local Heat Trapping is a medium draft priority. It's a very efficient card, but it's also fairly low impact. You're getting more than you paid for, but you didn't pay that much!",

            "body": "At 11+3 to draft and play, Lunar Mining isn't too expensive to get out. But getting out a good setup for it might break the bank. You'll want to play it early of course, since it is a production card, but you also need to get out other earth tags first. This can make it tough in some games to find the right time to play it. But in games where you already have good earth tags you want to play, it can be extremely efficient.\n\nIf you only have one earth tag out before Lunar Mining, you'll gain 1 titanium production. Titanium is worth 3, so it'll take 5 gens to break even (profit by 1), and you can only spend your profit on space tags. Not the worst, but certainly subpar compared to some other economy cards. If you have 3 earth tags out before Lunar Mining, that's 2 titanium production, which almost breaks even after 2 gens and profits in 3. Now we are cooking with gas. That's an efficient economy card. If you're able to get more than 2 titanium production, it's just fantastic.\n\nLunar Mining has good synergy with Point Luna, Earth Office, Cartel, Research Coordination, and other good earth tags.\n\nOverall, Lunar Mining is often a high draft priority early game and mid game. Even if you don't have the earth tags to make it work well, you don't want your opponents getting such an efficient economy boost. If it's early enough, it may even be worth buying and holding onto in case you find more earth tags to make it work. Colonies has loads of great space cards, so that titanium will definitely get used.",

And then the death blow on top is the fact it's 1 cost, meaning that your options for discounting it are extremely limited, which is *another* reason to play low impact cards that this loses access to.

The difference between -2 and 1 is still 3.\n\n> A discount of 2mc or 3mc affects low cost cards more than expensive cards\n\nNot really? For *any other discount*, I would agree, but in this case, the discount is \"drawing the card\". As such, no matter what card you draw, the discount is still always going to be 3MC. It's not like Earth Catapult, where the more cards you play the more of a discount you get; here, the discount will only apply to a single card, once.\n\n> Very often when you draw free cards, they are pretty useless due to max requirements, requirements you will never meet, or they increase parameters that are maxed, or they need a production/resource you don't have, or they just do nothing for you (floaters, microbes etc.)\n\nYes, this has more impact than a dead draw.

Someone else on this reddit kept insisting that the discount is 2mc which is just another way of looking at it (since the card isn't really free, you used an action/effect to get it), so I thought I'd mention it.\n\nThis card costs 4mc and at that price is barely playable, unless you have some tag synergy. You can get 3 or 4 mc back with it, or maybe an animal, and annoy an opponent a bit.  \nAs a free card however, this is 1mc and can pretty much always give back 2 to 4 mc. So the card changed from meh, to a sure play.  \nWith expensive cards, the difference is smaller. A good expensive card gets a bit better, and you're more likely to play it, and a bad card gets slightly less bad, increasing the chance you'll play it a little bit.  \nOf course if you DO play the card, the 3mc is the same. What I meant was the difference in how good the card becomes, as in how often you'll play it.\n\nSame case with dead draws. Maybe around 50% of cards can be dead draws middle game.

That’s pretty niche.\n\nBoth steel and heat are good early game and mid game. Steel tends to become worth a lot less in the last generations, because you need building cards worth VP to spend it on. Heat is worth something until the global parameter is maxed, which is usually during the last generation. After that its only use if for cards like heat trapping. However, some games have a temperature race going on, and temperature will be maxed late-midgame. Or you’re engine building and don’t want the game to end. In those cases, you’d want steel over heat. Problem is, this card costs 7mc and the action only gives 6mc, which makes it hard to get value out of it unless you have discounts or effects. And as an engine player, it’s rare you have enough heat (10) to make this card worth it.\n\nIt’s different if you factor in the tag and Milestones and Awards.\n\nThe tag is good for Builder (7 or 8 building tags), Contractor and Diversifier.\n\nA 4mc card is good for Incorporator.\n\nAnd steel resources count for Industrialist and Miner. (But it’s not great for Thermalist.)\n\nCheung Ching Mars gets 2mc discount. Recyclon needs 3 building tags for a plant production. But the best synergy with this card is Advanced Alloys and/or Rego Plastics.

It can also let you play Electro Catapult or Space Elevator and not worry about steel (production).\n\nIt’s especially good if you get discounts from Interplanetary Cinematics (2mc), Media Center (3mc), Research Outpost (1mc) or Earth Catapult (2mc), and/or have Advanced Alloys or Rego Plastics.

I think the cost of the card should be around 26-27 MC.\n\nIn any case, this is one of the best steel targets, especially since there are just a couple of cards that raise temp or place ocean and can be paid by steel..

With maybe 3mc discount if you’re Vitor or 2mc discount if you’re Valley Trust.\n\nThat’s expensive for just a science tag and 1VP, but you also get 1mc per colony in play and 1mc per city in play. And that can add up.\n\nIn 3 and 4 player, if strong colonies like Luna, Ceres and Pluto are in play, there are often 3 colonies on them. Especially if the game is without the Earth Government Terraforming step, or people have good Prelude 2 colony cards. It’s not uncommon to see 10+ colonies by midgame. In other games, with weak colonies, especially 2 player, or a 4 player TR rush, there might be one or no colonies.\n\nSame thing with cities. In a 4 player game, everyone may have around 2, maybe even 3 cities on Mars by late game. Add 1 to 3 space cities, and you’re easily at 10+. In another 4 player game, with TR rush and an oxygen bumper, you may only see 2, 1, or even no cities. In 2 player you often see very few cities.\n\nSo the price of buying and playing this card, late game, can be anywhere between paying 14mc and receiving 11mc or more.\n\nIf you can play this and receive mc, it’s a no brainer, but even if you end up paying for it, it can be really good if you can use it to play Anti Gravity, or have cards like Mars University, Venusian Animals, Bactoviral Research or Carbon Nanosystems.",

            "body": "Because the value of the difference is bigger? Molecular Printing is best in 4p and 5p so let’s look at that.\n\nMars University gives a card, but you also have to discard a card you bought at 3mc. So let’s put the value of replacing a card with a random card at 2mc.\n\nIn a 4p game, if you go for science tags, you may play about 4 to 6 of them after Mars University before the game ends. That’s 4x2mc to 6x2mc, minus the 2mc card cost difference. So Mars University is maybe 6 to 10 mc better than the probe, which is a lot.\n\nMolecular Printing is 5mc more expensive than the probe, but it can easily give 25+mc in the last gen of a 4p game.\nThey both give 1VP and a science tag, but Molecular Printing, in this case, also gives 25mc, making it 20mc better than the probe.\n\nPersonally I don’t mind some luck of the draw, but some people do, and I’ve heard people complaing about this card being “broken”. 20mc can buy you a few VP that can decide the game.\n\nAnother factor is psychological; if you have a bad opening, you can still hope for better cards and make a comeback. If you think you’re winning at the end if the last gen, and your opponent plays Molecular Printing as one of his last actions, gaining 25+mc, buys an award with it and leaps 6VP to the win, that can feel harsh, or maybe “unfair”. (Of course it isn’t, it’s just lucknof the draw.)\n\nYet another factor is that you can hold back a run away leader (maybe he has Mars University with science tag synergy) with asteroids and stealing cards and tile placement.\nBut you can do nothing against a player with an ace up his sleeve in the last gen. This ace might feel “earned” if he has hold onto the card and planned it, or “not earned” if it’s a last gen lucky draw.\nNB this is what I noticed in games, not neccesarily my own feelings.",

Ideally it's fairly early, you can place down the 3rd Ocean -> Greenery convert next to it/2 oceans in 2 plant spot -> play Nitro to go to 0 plants and whatever plant prod (this could easily be the first plant prod you play)\n\nOf course, it only gets even better with Viral/Deco/Eco/etc. or if it enables NRA/Insects\n\n**Edit**: Also, remember stuff like Viral can let you play this with just 1 plant, since you can resolve the +1 plant effect before you resolve the -2/+2",

A gen 1 ocean is also not rare. But an ocean next to a city in gen 1 or 2 is already a bit less common.\nAnd this card of course is a promo. Promos add a bunch more (very strong) corporations. So the chance thst Tharsis is in the game is much lower. Promos also add 5 strong preludes, meaning less chance if seeing Self-sufficient Settlement. Many games with promos/expansions won’t see a city next to an ocean in gen 1 or 2 when you’d want to play this card.\n\nVitor likes this card a bit better, for its 3mc reward.\nIt’s also more playable if you have Community Services.\n\nAnd it has some use when fighting for the Banker award, or the specialist (or even generalist) milestone.

Just to have that option available.  Getting energy-screwed for 2-3 generations (which has happened more often than I can believe, where you pull a card that requires -1 energy production and then literally don't draw or get passed an energy production card for 2-3 generations) is brutal.\n\nIf I'm already at 1-2, it'll depend on what else I've already got in my hand.

Getting 3VP or potentially 5+ VP for only 13mc is a pretty good deal. Except you’d rather not spend 13mc on VP in the first 2 generations, where you’d rather spend it on economy (income, card draw).\n\nWhere this card gets good is with tag synergy and Milestones& Awards.\n\nYou get Discounts or rebates with Vitor (3mc), Teractor (3mc), Point Luna (1 card), Ecotec (1 plant), Spire (2mc), Arklight (1/2VP), Aridor (2 mc production).\n\nThe animal tag is rare, especially early and mid game, and has synergy with Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, Decomposers, GMO Contract, and helps with Advanced Ecosystems.\n\nPets can be a backup plan for Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen, Local Heat Trapping etc.\n\nAnd Pets is very strong with Meat Industries! You get 2mc with every city played.\n\nThe Earth tag has synergy with many Earth engine cards: Earth Office, Solar Logistics, Cartel, Miranda Resort, Martian Zoo, Luna Metropolis/Gyropolis, Space Hotels, Luna Governor, Lunar Mining, Saturn Surfing, Cloud Tourism, Sponsoring Nation etc.\n\nA few synergies can make Pets very much worth playing.

Its best use case would be a game where only 1 colony is good early and Miranda is also present. Late game when the 1/VP animals are active, you can play Pioneer settlement for 3VP for 16MC and the -2MC penalty doesn't really matter since the game is likely ending that gen or the next gen.

Instead, you simply bribe those in charge of UN funding.\n\n\nThere's a nice interaction here: getting TR through illegitimate means generally comes with public disapproval. And public disapproval is represented by minus VPs.\n\n\nPositive VPs representing public approval is why Vitor likes them, btw.

No space tag, no building tag, high MC cost. This puts it into the same class of prohibitively priced cards as Earth Catapult while its effect is only very very minor in this comparison. Yes, there might be a situation where you **meet all the conditions** so that this card can be used effectively (1. you have the card, 2. you have the cash, 3. you want to enable your Physics Complex next round, 4. you have enough power tags so that the card would bring you to 6+ total energy prod this round and 5. you have no better alternatives), it's just not a situation that I usually come across.  \n  \nIt's also a rather expensive way to try and steal the Industrialist award. If you succeed then I can respect that (award steals are a *massive* 10 VP swing in 2P after all) but there are usually better ways (e.g. via steel rather than energy).

I believe Power Grid is one card that is overcosted and the game creators would agree on that. I can't find it now, but I have a vague memory of it being compared to Energy Saving by a game creator on some BGG forum and the game creator basically said that Power Grid should have costed less because it's usually on par with Energy Saving or slightly worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt 18+3 to draft and play, Power Grid is too big of an investment for what it does. The main issue is that even with Colonies, you just don't need THAT much power. If it's your first or second power tag, getting only 1 or 2 power from it is worse or just on par with the standard project, which is terrible. If it's your 3rd power tag and it gives 3 power, it's on par with other energy production cards, which often value energy production at about 7 each. But the problem is that if you already have two power tags out, you probably don't need much more energy production. Of course, Power Grid gets more efficient the more power tags you have, but that is nearly entirely offset by the fact that you don't need that much energy. At that point it just becomes worse heat production because you'll have to wait an extra gen for it to become usable heat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are some niche cases where it's worth it. Maybe you have an extra trade fleet, some oxygen pumper like Ironworks, maybe even a couple good city cards like Capital that want to decrease your energy, and you really can use all the energy you get! Then, Power Grid is a fantastic play as your 4th or 5th power tag. But also, if you had enough science tags for Mass Converter or Quantum Extractor, those would be even better because they are cheaper and give space tag discounts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, a low draft priority. Based on that BGG forum I read (or perhaps imagined?), I actually lowered the cost in my physical copy of the game by using a label maker. The cards are in sleeves so there's no risk of the label affecting shuffling or falling off. I put the cost at 14 instead of 18 and it makes the card feel way better to play.",

Or because you’re engine building and don’t want to terraform, and you have 10 energy production Quantum Extractor and Mass Converter, or from Energy Savings.\n\nThis card is either played late game, as a tiny steel dump, to turn worthless energy \nresources into a bit of mc, or early game for the tags.\n\nIt’s a cheap card with 2 tags. This is nice for Aridor and the Diversifier Milestone. Can also help with the Builder Milestone (7 or 8 building tags).",

However, in my opinion, money is worth a tiny amount more than heat, despite heat production being notably more expensive. But we're talking a *tiny* amount; something like 1 heat being worth 0.875 MC. \n\nSo you are making about .125 MC every time you use this on energy that would otherwise turn to heat... so you just need to spend 56 energy on this... *to break even*. Which based on production, should be happening every 4 rounds.\n\nMeanwhile, regardless of if it's heat or MC, used energy is worth WAY more in my mind; approximately 1.75 each. So each energy turning to heat would already be losing you half its value, and each energy turning to MC would be losing .75 MC.\n\nIn summary: This is a card that turns a situation you already shouldn't be putting yourself in into a marginally better situation for far too expensive a starting investment. It might help you if you are 1-2 MC short of playing a new card... except you could just not have spent this and use that 7 money on those.",

If you draw it then it's fine at 3 for a point.\n\nBut I typically view standard projects as a good baseline. SP costs +4, a point costs 5, a money prod costs 5 (thus a TR costs 10), and a tile costs 4. This works for all the terraforming (asteroid is TR+4, ocean is TR+tile+4, greenery is TR+tile+point+4) and leads to derived values of energy at 7 and a city at 16 (with 4 baked in for the tile).",

A lot of them are either super underwhelming (stuff like \"have a TR for cheap\"), super niche (\"you can get 2 MC production and a VP if you have 5 building tags and mars first is in power!\"), or just plain bad (Aerial Lenses). I'd say maybe half of them are good.]\n\nEven this one I think fits into the \"super niche\" category; if Reds are in charge and you are ground game heavy, this gets you like 10-15MC profit... but people who want ground game aren't gonna want reds in charge.",

Typically the person who relies the least on terraforming to build his economy, alternatively someone who can stockpile resources to terraform a lot the following turn. It is a potential way to protect your plants or hinder other players from claiming bonus steps in a turn where you would otherwise be the last player. It can be used to drag the game into an extra generation for a strong engine player. It can also counter a few cards that give a lot of TR, typically played on the last generation like Terraforming Ganymede.\n\n\nI will argue that timing when to vote in reds and greens is what sets apart good players from bad players in turmoil.",

I know many people are afraid to use this for the negative income which looks horrible, but 1VP per round with no conditions is actually good. Not worth playing gen 1 obviously, but mid game it is fine.\n\n\n\nLast generation this is 10BC for 1VP, two gens before end it is 11BC for 2VP, three gens it is 13BC for 3VP (which is already a good rate), four 16BC for 4VP etc. ... Every point is worth (REMAINING\\_GENS - 1). You just estimate the length of the game and decide when it begins being worth it. If you have plenty of cash to burn (big income, low cards count), it might be even pretty early actually.\n\n\n\nOn top of that Earth tag is nice and the fact that the resources cannot be eaten by Predators or Virus is a good bonus too.\n\n\n\nThe only real downside is that this does not help speed up the game if you need that or if you use it and then change your mind and stop using it, its efficiency drops by a lot.\n\n\n\nOverall I love when people pass this to me in draft :)",

Oh, and it also has the all time popular science tag. For the cheap increase of 6 MC over a standard action colony, which is already a very solid investment. It is often said the colony cards are undercosted, and plays with the research colony is a good reason this opinion exists.",

You likely want to take the ones you can get. Restricted Area also comes with a science tag, which can help you build towards strong science cards that need tags like AI Central or Anti-Gravity. The cards you draw may allow you to find other science tags, making Restricted Area a great pick for a science strategy.\n\nHowever, it won't help you build up your resources to play cards. It's a drain on money, costing you 2 each gen to draw the card. So it's a judgement call on when you want to play it. Too early and it stifles your economy, too late and you miss out on drawing as many cards.\n\nOverall, a strong card in the right situations and generally a medium draft priority.

Bad.\n\nBest case, you have 5 Earth tags when you play it plus a way to freely replenish the floaters. That's 1 VP and 5 MC production for 11 (13 + 3 - 5 from one activation). A great deal, plus incredible potential value if you can get Hoverlord with it.\n\nExpected uses fall somewhere in-between the two extremes. What's the point where it pays off? It costs 16 to buy and play, and if we say the VP is worth 5, then the floater payout (plus extra benefit from the tags) must be worth 11. How many floaters do we need to make $11 off this? Between 4 and 5.(5+4+3+2+1 =15, 4+3+2+1=10). You'll want some fuel to make this one work, in the form of enough floaters to make a profit and/or claim Hoverlord.\n\nSo the important factors to consider when buying and playing this card seem to be:\n\n1) How many floaters can I place and keep here?\n2) Can I nab Hoverlord with this?\n2) How do I benefit from an extra Earth and Jovian tag?",

Even the titanium production cards are 10:1 whereas MCP is 5:1.\n\nWhen looking at it through that lens, it’s actually a fairly reasonable ratio of “2MC:1VP”. For 15 cost, it only takes 5 rounds to net even. That said... 5 rounds is a lot.\n\nBut that’s where the twist comes in: you can pay this entirely in titanium. Which the game evaluates as 2MC.

If used to play 1 card every other turn, it's 2MC production. If used to play 1 card per 3 turns, it's 2 and 2/3 MCP. If used to play 1 card per 4, it's 4MCP. And theoretically, 1 card per 5 is 6 and 2/5ths MCP but you'd have to get 32-cost cards and you'd only be able to do it twice.\n\nSo basically, if you aren't playing slower than 1 card per 4 turns with this, this is a bad return on investment.

Possible the best, most overpowered, card in the game.\n\nIt's 18mc + 3mc card cost, and can be paid for in titanium. Meaning it benefits from alloys and space card discounts.\n\nIt gives 2VP, and -1mc discount on all cards.  \nThe first one is great late game, when the -1mc/card is just nice, and -1mc/card is great early game.  \nThe card also gives you an Earth tag, which is very useful, especially with expansions.\n\nThe most important deal is the extra trade fleet. There are only 3 cards in the deck that give this (because the creators didn't want you to run out of white triangles, and for some reason they only put 8 of the little plastic pieces in the box, and 5 players + 3 =8).  \nThe extra trade fleet can be \"just nice\" or totally game breaking, depending on player count, other cards you have, and colony tiles in play. If it's a 3 player game, and Luna and Ceres and/or Pluto or maybe Triton/Miranda are in play, it can be crazy good.  \nYou can empty the two best ones if you're starting player. And in the two other rounds, you can just take whatevers left, lowering the track for the others.\n\nThe only downside is its 2 Earth tag requirement. Which can be really easy if you start with the right corporation and preludes with earth/wild tags, or somewhat annoying if you have to wait a bit to play it.\n\nCompared with Earth Catapult, this costs 5mc less and has a space tag/can be paid in titanium. Both give 2VP. You get a trade fleet and -1mc/card instead of -2mc/card. A trade fleet is about as good as -1mc/card (valued at about 10). Meaning this card is better value for money than Earth Catapult. Locked behind a mild requirement.\n\nExtremely good with Point Luna, Teractor and Vitor. (they have an earth tag, and give a discount).  \nGreat with Phobolog, to spend its titanium on. Good with Aridor and Poseidon.  \nOf course very strong with Cryo Sleep and Rim Freighters (pay 1 less per trade) and with Trade Envoys and Trading Colony (move track one step). Since these are effects, they are practically doubled.",

Earth Catapult of course gives 2mc discount. But Sky Docks is 5mc cheaper to play, can be paid in titanium (can benefit from Advanced/Mercurian Alloys) and can benefit from space tag discounts (a lot of them give 2mc discount), so it’s much more affordable.\n\nWith only this -points and card discount- Sky Docks would already be a very good card. Comparible to Research Outpost or Earth Catapult light. But on top of that it also gives a trade fleet! One of only three in the game.\n\nThe extra trade fleet can be extremely strong if the colonies in play are strong (if 2 or more of Luna, Ceres, Pluto, Trition, maybe Miranda or Titan are in play) and you preferably have a colony there. If you’re start player after getting this, you can clear the best 2 colonies before other players can get to it. And the turn after that clear the second and third best colonies.\n\nThe extra trade fleets power is amplified if you have one or a few cards that make trading stronger or cheaper. Like Cryo Sleep or Rim freighters (-1 trade cost on both trades), or Trade Envoys or Trading Colony (increase colony track 1 step on both trades).\n\nThis card has great synergy with all colony related cards, Earth tag engine cards (Earth Office, Point Luna, Cartel, Lunar Mining, Solar Logistics etc.), Space tag cards (Space Station, Satellites, Advanced/Mercurian Alloys etc.) but also Vitor, Spire, and Cutting Edge Technology.\n\nIt’s also pretty good for the Milestones Terran (5 Earth tags), Spacefarer (4 Space tags), Tactician (5 or 4 cards with requirement), Planetologist and Diversifier.  And the Awards Investor (most Earth tags), Space Baron (most space tags), Forecaster (most cards with requirements), and Traveller.",

But the game won’t give you a 1VP animal, or temperature is too slow for Fish. 2VP from 4 small animals can be a better option than 5 plants.\n\nSmall Animals costs only 6mc, so getting the card for free (saves 3mc) or a discount (like Earth cat.) matters a lot. Small Animals has synergy with a lot of cards, due to the animal tag and resources.\n\nIt’s best with Meat Industries (quickly earns its playing cost back), but also with Ecological Zone, Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems etc. Nice when you’re playing Arklight. Good target for an Early Mohole Lake. And lastly, when Predators are done eating opponents animals, they can eat an uneven small animal you own for 1VP.",

            "body": "I think there's a breakdown somewhere of what each thing is basically worth in terms of money, and you can use that to evaluate cards.\n\nBut generally speaking, at the start you want to play things that help your economy (so, things that increase MC/Steel/Titanium production, or things that cheaply increase your TR). You can play these cards later, but you want to be getting more out of them than the money you invested in playing them, so the earlier the better.\n\nThen, you want to use that economy to get victory points. Usually people either go for:\n\n1. Terraforming/cities/greeneries (with milestones and awards)\n\n2. VP engines with animals, science cards with card draw, and big cards that have lots of VP on them\n\n3. Some combination of 1 and 2\n\nPeople doing 1 generally want the game to end faster (ie. while they are still winning), so they will try to terraform as much as possible. People doing 2 want to drag it out longer (so they can find cards to let them overtake the other players), so they will terraform less.\n\nObviously this is simplifying things a lot. But basically, how good each card is depends on what you're trying to do. Most cards can be good in some kind of situation.\n\n(except for Underground Detonations, that card blows)",

For that investment, you get a plant tag, a heat production and a plant production\n\nSnow Algae follows a trend of the game designer overvaluing plant production. Plants and heat basically do nothing until you get to 8 of them, meaning Snow Algae has no immediate payoff and no near-future payoff either in most games. It's unlikely that one more of either really makes the difference to get you a greenery or temperature step much sooner.\n\nThat being said, sometimes it's nice to have an extra plant tag and sometimes it's a good compliment to a fast Terraforming strategy that already is going for plant and heat production. It just would be nicer if it costed less. I think if Snow Algae was 9 cost instead of 12, or if it just had a building tag to make it easier to play, it would make the world of difference.\n\nOverall, a low draft priority. It's a low impact and overcosted card. Even when it fits right into your strategy it's just okay, not especially great.",

The bad thing is that you need the microbe, but you can easily take one from a card that would end with odd number of microbes but gives one VP for every 2, so most of the time if you have some microbes cards and can plan a little ahead it does not matter. Also while sometimes it will give an extra greenery, which is great, but sometimes it will be a dead card (but you don't have to play it then, just sell it).\n\nOverall the effect is decent and tags are situational but have some synergies and as with all cheap cards, if you draw this instead of buy to hand then the value ratio is pretty good.",

At 23Mc to buy and play it returns 6 so its basic cost is 17.  It gives a vp which can be worth 3-5MC so lets just say, 13mc is the cost for its effect. \n\nDrawing a card on space event is pretty strong. Like optimal aerobraking, this is a rebate for playing cards that are typically already pretty good.  The fact that it triggers on any player playing one, though, is bonkers.  It almost guarantees this card will generate enough value for its cost.\n\nThat’s not even mentioning the discount. The earth tag reduction is valued by the game pretty low if earth office is anything to go by.  But discounts are discounts and are pretty good, and plenty of space events have an earth tag too so this helps you play synergistic cards as well. \n\nEven if we value the discount at a meager 3Mc, basing it off of earth office, this card’s draw effect costs 10Mc.  You do not need to draw that many cards to get your return for 10MC.  Comparing to draw cards like Business Contacts (10mc) and tech demo (8Mc), you’d only need to draw 3-4 cards before you’re getting your money’s worth out of playing solar logistics. \n\nIf you have a couple space events in your hand, you’re basically guaranteed to hit that mark.  Which makes the decision to draft this card pretty easy. You draft it almost always unless a better card is in the mix; and you almost always buy it unless it’s the end of the game.\n\nAlso it’s annoying when another player is drawing cards when it’s my turn without expending actions.",

Especially in the early gens 20mc feels like a huge investment in relation to what it gives you and when and if it will be useful. I mean:\n\n\\-2mc discount for earth tags: nice but I prefer to take -3 discount for a cost of 1+3 (earth office)\n\n\\-Gain 2 titanium: nice if there is an immediate use for that titanium\n\n\\-1VP: yeah, that will be useful when the game ends\n\n\\-Draw card when space event is played: nice but I can't fully control if and when they will be played.\n\nFor me, if feels best to play it in the mid game when I myself have 2+ space events in my hand that I am about to play.

Even in those situations (that I think are ideal for this card) it feels expensive to play just before those space events, even though the titanium bonus surely does help..",

It has a VP which is better late game and an energy production which is better earlier on.\n\nThe building tag can make Solar Power easier to play if you have steel to spare. If not, it's kind of expensive for what it does. Energy production is usually worth about 7 from cards, and VP is often worth about 5. This leaves the card at a total theoretical cost of 12, yet you'd have to pay 14 to actually draft and play it. Further, VP is only worth 5 late game, and energy is only worth 7 if you need it which is more likely earlier on.\n\nIf playing as Mining Guild or you have a lot of steel production, it can be nice to have any building tags with points or production on them. So you might end up playing Solar Power. But only out of convenience. There are plenty of other building tags that you'd rather get. \n\nThe main exception would be if you are playing with Colonies. Energy production is so important for trading, that any card with energy production at all is worth considering. But of course, if you are deciding between Solar Power and a better energy card like Giant Space Mirrors, you should take the one that helps you get to 3 energy production more easily.\n\nOverall, a kind of lackluster card. It likely costs a little bit more than it should. If I was going to change it, I would add a money production in there. It would still be awkward to play, but in the right situation it could be more worth it that way.",

Your early money needs to go to colonies and energy production if you want to compete, so playing expensive do-nothing cards gets even worse.",

It costs about 5 money per heat production. \n\nOf course, the space tag can help if you have titanium to spend.\n\nIt makes sense to compare it to other heat providing cards. Soletta is 35+3 to draft and play and gives 7 heat production. It costs 12 more and gives 2 more heat production. So, actually it's a slightly worse rate! Usually more expensive cards get better bulk discounts. But in this case, the cheaper card has the better rate.\n\nGetting 5 heat production early in the game will mean the temperature rises faster and it will add up to a bunch of TR over time. This can be fantastic for a terraform rushing strategy. It also lets you safely pick cards that have high heat requirements and be fairly sure you'll get to play them before oxygen gets too high. So the game control this provides you with is hard to quantify, but it's very important. Naturally, it goes best with other sources of heat production. Getting to 8 heat production is amazing to know that you'll get a free temperature increase every Gen.\n\nOverall, a great card and a high draft priority early on. Of course, any production based card gets less impactful the later in the game you play it. But this is basically an auto pick if I see it in the first 3 gens. Even if I don't want to push the temperature up this game, I don't want someone else to do it either! So it's either a great purchase or a great hate-draft. Don't let it fall into the wrong hands!",

It’s basically like playing micro mills 7 times, but 4mc cheaper.\n\nAnd you get 7 heat with it in gen 2. 1 short of the 8 heat needed to raise temperature.\n\nIt got “replaced” by Solar Reflectors in an expansion. Solar Reflectors gives 5 heat production for 23+3=26mc. That’s 5.2mc per heat production.\n\nWith the better 5.2mc per heat production, or even a reasonable 5mc per heat production, Soletta would cost 32mc or 33mc. Or it could’ve been a 8 heat production card for 37mc or 38mc. But as is, Soletta is a few mc too expensive for what it does.\n\nMohole area gives 4 heat production for 20+3=23mc but you get to place a tile on an ocean spot. With placement and adjacency bonus, you usually end up paying less than 5mc per heat production.\n\nhttps://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#164#203#142#C38\n\nCan be ok for UNMI or Helion. And of course you want Thermalist.",

Even if you're rushing, this can be worth playing if its early enough just for the income: titanium >> steel in this case since space events are so terraforming-heavy. Even this, this is lower priority than, say, setting up trade.\n\nWith only a finite amount of steel, it's a harder sell. I would want some other contributing factor before playing it, like an excess of steel/titanium to pay for it.

This card hampers you because its max playable parameter is just below the point where it would hit the TR bonus. \n\nBut it still makes it more likely that you’ll be able to snag either the card bonus or the tr bonus. I consider cards like this to provide this value intrinsically, like the player with Deimos down will, generally, be guaranteed to grab the ocean bonus, and I consider this to be a bonus of having Deimos in your hand. \n\nPlayers with Towing a Comet generally have a better shot at grabbing the oxygen bonus. \n\nSame here; this card gives you a better shot of grabbing the bonuses, and if you want the card bonus it’s unlikely other players will drop giant solar shade or something to grab it over you.",

You also get a building tag for Builder or Contractor.\n\nIt’s better if you pay with steel that’s worth 3mc, or if you get a tag/card bonus like the 2mc bonus from Manutech or Earth Catapult.\n\nSo, already playable, but of course they also gave this card a really good card draw effect, so let’s look at that:\n\nYou get a card with every 20mc+ card. There are 62 of these cards in the game. That’s 16% of the deck. With just base+prelude, it’s 32 cards, or 14.9% of the deck. That’s about 1 in 7 cards. And most of these are really good cards, that you’d want to play anyway, like the big asteroids, or Jovian multipliers.\n\nRealistically, if you play Spin-off early, you’ll play about 2 or 3 20mc+ cards, and if you’re playing engine, it’s 3 to 5, possibly more, 20mc+ cards (from my experience playing with Credicor and/or going for Celebrity Award).\n\nA card with a cost of 10 should give about 3 or 4 cards, based on base game cards. Spin-off can easily do that.\n\nSo, both effects are playable on their own. Put them both on the same card for the same cost, and you get a really strong card that’s high value for money. You either get a bunch of cards and 2 free mc production, or you get 2 mc production and a handful of free cards, depending on how you want to look at it.\n\nCan be very strong if played early. Especially if you’re Credicor, who now gets 4mc AND a card for every 20mc+ card.\n\nCan also be insanely good for Point Luna, who now draws 2 cards when playing Earth Catapult, Imported Nitrogen, Large Convoy, Luna Metropolis, Interstellar Colony Ship, Earth Elevator etc. And of course those drawn cards can have Earth tags as well.\n\nNot a card to carelessly pass in draft. However, if it’s the last gen, both the mc income and the card draw effect could be worthless.",

            "body": "At 12+3 to draft and play, Stratospheric Birds is a medium investment. It also costs a floater, which normally isn't a big cost, it's more of a requirement. And there's of course the overt requirement of 12% Venus (6 Venus steps). If you fulfill the requirements and play it, you'll be getting 1VP per gen including the one you play it in. You'll also get a great place to dump any extra animals you come across who need a place to live for 1VP each. \n\nNaturally, more gens left when you play Stratospheric Birds means more VP. If you have 2 gens left after the one you play it in, that's 3VP, which is a cost of 5 each. A decent rate. Less than that would be a hard sell and more than that would be awesome.\n\nThis makes Stratospheric Birds very situational. Many games you just won't be able to play it or won't be able to play it early enough. Either because you don't have a floater to spend, or because Venus gets ignored, as it does in many games. This card is a great example of the problem of expansion dilution. If you play with all the expansions, you likely won't get enough Venus to make Birds playable. There's just too many other cards. But if playing with just Venus as your only expansion? Stratospheric Birds will surely come out if drafted early.\n\nOverall, a low-medium draft priority most games. The requirements are steep, and although it can be very efficient when played early, it doesn't snowball. It just gives some VP. And money spent early on VP instead of production has a big opportunity cost.",

This can give it great synergy with both bio cards and Venus cards, and also Spire. And a bunch of tag and resource related milestones and awards.

There's a minor drawback of having to take floaters off the card before you have access to the titanium, but it also helps you claim the Hoverlord milestone, especially if you have one support card.\n\nIt's even better with the Turmoil expansion as well since a well-timed Unity party will make all that titanium worth 1 more.\n\n.\n\nEDIT: a lot of people have commented on my \"2 titanium production\" statement. Mostly, they seem to look at this card and try to calculate its long-term benefits, which sounds like a good approach, but fails the mark since they skip over the floaters you get the generation you play it. Those feel like a one-turn benefit that is trivial when you extrapolate to many generations, but those first two floaters are, in fact, very important.\n\nSo, you play Titan Shuttles, then you use the action and now you have 2 floaters on it. This progresses as follows:\n\n|Generation Played|Floaters before remove/+2 action| Floaters after +2 action\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|0|2\n|2|2|4\n|3|4|6\n\nCompare this to Asteroid Mining which simply has 2 titanium production:\n\n|Generation Played|Titanium in current gen|\n|:-|:-|\n|1|0|\n|2|2|\n|3|4|\n\nThe important pattern here is that Titan Shuttles is exactly 2 titanium production the first time you remove floaters. You will exactly as many titanium as you would have when you played Asteroid Mining.\n\nNow, there's details: after removing floaters, it's a bit worse for titanium production, the upfront cost is -7, there is one VP fewer but more floater synergies (Every \"add a floater to any card\" action card is now a titanium production unless you have something even better), etc. etc.\n\nOne more counterargument against the 2 titanium production is that you need to spend it all in one go. But that's not a problem if you are running Turmoil since people tend to save up titanium for Unity generations anyway. Considering Hoverlord, it's definitely a better gen1 play than Asteroid Mining, although not by very much.\n\nA very interesting card, and I hope this illustrates to newer players how to value the action on this card.",

            "body": "This card is occasionally pretty good in gen 1 or 2. But most of the time, there aren’t enough opponents space tags in play (at least 3) to justify the 15mc (12 in titanium) price tag. Mid game there can be more space tags, and you may have a space tag discount, but mc production is worth less. With 4 players, there are more opponents space tags, but the game usually only lasts until gen 7 or 8. In 5 player, the game lasts until gen 6, making mc production worth less. In my games, this card is often not worth playing in gen 1 or 2, and also just a bit off from worth playing midgame.\n\nThe card is balanced by the game, because 4 players games do have more opponents space tags, but also take less generations to finish. Also, often when you want to play this, you’re the one playing space/engine, and maybe one other opponent is.\n\nPrelude doesn’t help this card. There are only 4 space tag corporations (before prelude 2) and only 1 sees a lot of play (Point Luna). (The other ones are Helion, Phobolog and Astrodrill.) And there’s only ONE out of 40 preludes with a space tag (before prelude 2). This means there usually aren’t many opponents space tags in play in gen 1, when you want mc production.\n\nOf course it can be strong early game, but in competitive 4player base+prelude, it’s not considered a super strong or problematic card at all. I don’t think it needs house rules or fan made nerfs. (It can be overpowered in specific setups, like a 3 player no prelude game with Venus, with no Earth Goverment Terraforming and Mandatory Venus track. ie a setup designed to last a lot of generations.)\n\nThat leaves late game. Toll Station is great in most games to swing the Banker Award on Tharsis map.\n\nIt’s can also be good for the Milestones Specialist, Fundraiser and Spacefarer.\n\nToll Station can be compared to:\n\nSponsors: 9mc -> 2 mc production, 4.5/mc\n\nAcquired Company 13mc -> 3 mc production, 4.33/mc\n\nCartel (with 3 additional earth tags) 11mc -> 4 mc production, 2.75/mc\n\nSpace Hotels 15mc -> 4 mc production, 3.75/mc\n\nIf you have Earth Office, these values change to 3/mc, 3.33/mc, 2/mc and 3/mc\n\nFor Toll Station to be as good as Acquired Company or Space Hotels, opponents need 4 or more space tags in gen 1, or 5+ in gen 2. That’s quite rare.\n\nFor Toll station to be as good as Cartel or Earth Office + Space Hotels, it needs 5 or more space tags in gen 1, or 6+ in gen 2.\n\nFactor in playing with point Luna with an Earth tag mc production (Cartel) opening, and you get sonething I’ve heard people complain about. I’ve never actually heard people complain about Toll Station in RL. It’s usually considered mainly an important Banker swing card, like Zeppelins.",

            "body": "At 6+3 = 9 to draft and play, this is not a big investment at all. And it tends to be one that starts paying off immediately, meaning it's true cost is most often less than 9. \n\nThis could be an extra card from Pluto, extra metal from Ceres/Triton, extra resource on a card from Enceladus/Miranda/Titan, etc. You're almost always getting at least 3MC of value from increasing the colony track, sometimes getting another VP from it, which could be worth a lot more late game. But even taking the low end of only getting around 3MC worth a gen, this is still an insanely good value for the investment. Usually you can profit 2 gens after playing Trade Envoys, which makes many other strong economy cards, like Sister Planet Support, Space Hotels, or Lunar Exports pale in comparison.\n\nIf it's speed to profit wasn't good enough, it's flexibility to choose what kind of profit you want each gen by choosing your trade makes it unquestionably one of the best economy cards around. And still further if speed and flexibility weren't good enough, it also has an incredible synergy with the extra trade fleet cards. You get to increase the track every time you trade, even if that's multiple times in the same gen. Getting Trade Envoys + Space Port Colony out in the mid game may shoot you so far ahead that your opponents will want to forfeit.\n\nThe only slight downside is that it won't do much if you don't have the energy to trade. Even with increasing the track, it's unlikely to make trading worth paying 9 MC or 3 titanium for (if it wasn't already worth it.) But every game of Colonies I've played has been a rush to get energy for trading. So it seems like Trade Envoys makes the already best strategy much better.\n\nOverall, an extremely high draft priority. Up there alongside Anti-grav, AI central, Advanced Alloys, Electro-Catapult, and other high impact game-changing cards. Trading is already incredibly powerful. Trade Envoys makes it even stronger!",

At a certain point, heat prod starts to mean less and less, especially if thermalist is not in play or u cant contest it at all, but u have some heat prod. So u won't need it and can maybe extract some value out of 3 gold production if u didnt play it in last gen. U might steal second/first place on banker as well. Anyhow, I started to take it more often (and so did others in my playgroup). I think this card has a lot more use than u think at first.

All decent players play power prod and power hungry cards in the same go to avoid getting tapped, but that doesn't mean Energy Tapping is bad, but rather that it is very influential.\n\nAlso, I find that most uses of this card are in cases where you place it immediately after placing a city next to one of your opponent's. Although of course, that case is not as satisfying as placing it between two of your opponent's cities, it is still quite strong and can be forced by yourself regularly.\n\nI think Urbanized Area is an above average card that I regularly find myself taking or at least cutting in the mid- to lategame.",

As the card does not give any points late game it is just a dead draw and even mid game for 7BC it is not great.\n\nThe two Venus tags required is also a big drawback - there will be games where you get it from gen 1 (and then the card is good), but in many cases that won't be the case. And there is not actually big use for the 2 Venus tags on this one (maybe there will be just some award?) - unlike with Earth or Jovian tags.\n\nWhat saves this from being weak card is the fact that any discounts reduce the cost significantly and allow shifting the economics of the card in your favor.",

And you pay 20 + 3mc card cost = 23mc for it.\n\nYou can get a nice 4mc discount with Credicor. Or 3mc with Venus Contract, or 2mc with Aphrodite, Venus waystation, Venus Contract or Terraforming Deal. It’s useful for the Venuphile award, which is in every Venus game, or the award for most 20mc+ cards.\n\nThe plant income is especially useful if that brings you up to 4 or 8 plant production. And the plant tag can be great if you have Insects or Nitrogen Rich Asteroid coming up! The Venus tag can be useful for many cards that give a mc production per venus tag (or 2 with Aridor) and some cards give a plant or floater per Venus tag. There are also a bunch of good cards with Venus tag requirements, like Venus trade hub.\n\nThis card is probably worth playing if you can get the Venus track TR bonus with it (or the Colony bonus on Amazonis Planitia!) The Venus step can also help unlock strong Venus cards you may have, like Stratospheric Birds, Sulphur-eating Bacteria or Venusian Animals.\n\n2 microbes can be worth a Global Parameter TR, or 1VP (ants) or 2/3VP, or 4 or 6mc. They can even swipe the Excentric Award.\n\nLate game, you can also have a fortune on Psychrophiles or Dirigibles, and you can only spend that on plant or Venus cards. This is a pretty good dump for that.\n\nIf you have all of the above examples, this card can be really good value for money.

Many games won’t see Venus get to 16%. In practice, it needs Venus 7 steps, since someone at the table will probably do the 8th step for the TR bonus.\n\nIf people play with World Government terraforming (I recommend it when Venus is added) and one player is dedicated to Venus, then there’s a good chance that 16% will be reached.\nThere’s also the game variant where the Venus track in mandatory for game end.\n\nThe 16% Venus requirement means that you can’t get the free TR on the Venus track with this card UNLESS you’re Inventrix or Morning Star or have Adaptation Technology or play Special Design. (Inventrix + Merger Morning Star then play Adaptation Technology would be  an interesting game.)\n\nYou can place the animal on Stratospheric Birds or Venus Animal (<but only if you’re Inventrix/Morning Star/Adaptation tech.) and it’s worth 1VP.

If played early, Viral Enhancers can easily earn you a Greenery in plants, and a few VP in animals/microbes. It can also make ‘meh’ microbe cards playable, by giving them an extra start microbe for their action. And it’s very strong in combination with bio engine cards like Decomposers, Ecological Zone, Topsoil/GMO Contract and Advanced Ecosystems/Ecology Research.\n\nOnly if it’s very late game, and you don’t have bio tags to play (and neither do your opponents!), that you can ignore this card. It’s also less good if you’re Standard Technology Credicor and are doing Standard Projects and 20mc+ cards. It’s stronger in games where you play more cards (tags), so engine, promos, expansions without Earth Government Terraforming, and lower player count, especially 2 player.",

AI central is often not worth it if you can’t readily cough up the steel, power production and science tags. And it’s often too late to play it. Even Earth Catapult sometimes comes too late to play it. Viral Enhancers is kinda like Advanced Alloys, both are cheap, have a science tag, and can be REALLY good value for money.

(And not doing your first action in gen 1 as Valley Trust, or Playing Valley Trust with Merger after gen 1.)\n\nThe requirement (Chairman) means you can play this in generation 2 or later (or in generation 1 with Vote of no confidence). The requirement is easier in 2 player, and much harder (to get early) in 4 or 5 player, where often at least 1 other player really wants to be Chairman.\n\nThis card is 9 + 3mc card cost = 12mc for 1 Prelude card. That’s the same price as what you pay with a Board of Directors resource, but WG Project gives you 1 out of 3 preludes to pick from, instead of just 1 prelude that you may buy or not for 12mc. The best out of 3 makes it much less risky.\n\nYou also get an Earth tag, and a card with a requirement, which may be useful for the Terran and Tactician Milestones and the Investor and Forecaster Awards. The Earth tag is really great if you have an Earth tag strategy, with Teractor (3mc) / Point Luna (1 card), Earth Office (3mc) and cards with the Cartel effect, Miranda Resort, Cloud Tourism, Lunar Mining, Solar Logistics, Martian Zoo (1VP), PR Office etc. A cheap Earth tag card can sometimes pay for itself.\n\nThe average worth (in “quantified value”) of a Prelude card (Prelude 2 and promos included) is around 25. And the average value of a best out of 3 Prelude is 28. However, a lot of preludes give production, and the value of production drops significally after generation 1. The average value of a prelude goes down quite a bit every generation in the first few generations. Still, some preludes give M€, useful resources or TR, which is still great by game end. A few Preludes even gain value, like Loan (30mc and -2mc production).\n\nPaying 12mc for a prelude is a fun gamble that can often go well if it’s best out of 3. However, there’s also a real chance you draw into mc production, steel production, heat production, or maxed out Oceans by midgame.\n\nThe luck/casino effect is maybe why they made this a Turmoil card.

            "body": "One of the 4 Jovian multipliers, and since it’s a multiplier, it can be worth a lot of points. At least 1, but potentially 10+, meaning that even if you can’t use it, you might want to hatedraft it for the Jovian player, or risk letting him win.\n\nThis is the most flexible/interesting Jovian multiplier. You’ll want to play Io Mining early (gen 1 or 2) to use its production, and Terraforming Ganymede late, since it counts Jovian tags already played. Ganymede Colony is usually played late too (unless you need it for Mayor). But you can play Water Import from Europa both late game (last gen, when you have a lot of titanium) for the points, mid game, or early game, gen 1 even, for the ocean action. The downside is that you communicate your Jovian strategy.\n\nThe ocean action is decent. An ocean placement is worth ~14 and the Standard Project cost is 18mc. This card can give you an ocean for only 12mc, and you can pay in titanium! Meaning that if you’re Phobolog or have Advanced or Mercurian Alloys, an Ocean is only 3 titanium.\n\nIf there’s an ocean area still open that gives 2 titanium or 2 cards, 12mc or 3 or 4 titanium for 1 Ocean TR is a good play. Or if there’s an ocean area that gives 2 plants and 2 or 4 mc adjacency bonus, especially if you’re sitting on 6 plants.\n\nIf the good placement bonus spots are filled, you might be better off spending the 12mc/titanium on cards in hand. Unless you’re Lakefront Resorts, have Arctic Algae, want to play a requirement card like Kelp Farming, or are going for an ocean (adjacency) related Milestone or Award.\n\nSo, depending on Corporation and cards in hand, the 12mc ocean action can be just ok, very strong, or practically useless, and that dictates when you’ll want to play this card. Of course this card is extra good if you’re Saturn Systems or the Rim Settler Milestone is in play, which can also be a reason to play it early.",

It’s  very rare that the 9 oceans are the last global parameter to be maxed. Usually they’re gone long before oxygen and temperature are maxed, in most games before the 0 degrees ocean bonus even. Oceans don’t bring forth game end in practice.\n\nWeaker players DO love Jovians, I’ve noticed that. The difference I think is that experienced players know when playing them is viable and when it’s not.\n\nExpansions and promos steer the game towards engine play (although it depends on game setup) and increases the percentage of space cards and the availability and value of titanium. The percentage of jovian tags is also increased, especially with Colonies. A good Jovian prelude is added (Planetary Alliance). This makes a Jovian strategy more viable, not less.",

Plantation can be hard to play first gen (2 science tags requirement), but is usually not hard to play middle or late game. Wildlife Dome can be played first gen (Greens are in power), but can require buying delegates later in the game.\n\nA Greenery is worth about 19mc (1TR, 1 point, points for cities and placement bonus) based on the price of the standard project -4. So, both cards, at 18mc are ok value for money.  \nThe card Mangrove only costs only 12mc + 3mc card cost, and gives 1VP, but it can often only be played when oxygen is maxed due to the 4C requirement, and it is limited to ocean spaces.\n\nIf you play Wildlife Dome in gen 1, you immediately get 4mc back from Green's policy. So actual cost is 14mc. The tags will give mc during the game. If Greens come into power, you'll get 2mc for the tags. And if Mars first comes into power, you'll get 1mc.\n\nGreat with Decomposers, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone etc. because of the plant AND animal tag. Great for things that collect tags like Aridor and Interplanetary trade.\n\nThe card is great for a (surprise) Gardener Milestone, and also helps with Builder and the Landlord award.  \nOn Hellas it's 3/8 tags for Diversifier, 1/5 cards for Tactician, a possible 1/3 tiles for Polar Explorer, and  it counts for the awards Cultivator and Contractor!  \nOn Elysium it's 2/4 tags for Ecologist, and helps with the awards Benefactor and possibly Desert Settler  and Estate Dealer.",
