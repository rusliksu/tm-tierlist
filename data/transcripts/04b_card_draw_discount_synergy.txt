Hello welcome back to my Terraforming Mars 
strategy guide on YouTube today is episode   4 synergies part two and today we're going to 
talk about what I think is the strongest type   of synergy in the game and that is card-draw plus 
Card-discount I think after the first video I made   a lot of people got the impression that I only 
care about Mega credit production and stuff like   this and that's probably my fault but no no 
no no no this is where it's at this is really   really good if you have just a little bit of money 
income but then on the other hand you have a lot   of card-draw you have a lot of Card-discount this 
is how you can go GODMODE it's way stronger than   getting Mega Credit-production in episode 16 part 
1 which is a game I played on the mars app I call   it the power of card draw this is like a perfect 
example of what you could do with card draw Plus   Card discount I don't have a lot of money income 
that game but I still went GODMODE so in this   video I'm gonna do my best to explain to you why 
I think this type of synergy is so good card-draw   Plus Card discount then we're also going to look 
at a theory craft deck we talked about a little   bit in the last video but today we're gonna like 
go all in and talk about this deck because this   deck is like GODMODE made into a starting hand 
it got so much card-draw so much Card discount   and a little bit of money income and very very 
strong so in the first video I gave this little   bit of a weird statement that I think the value 
of discount cards is squared meaning that if you   have two discount on cards like Earth Catapult 
then it's like worth four Mega credit production   if you have three discount on all cards it's like 
like worth nine Mega credit production and if you   have four discount on cards it's worth 16 Mega 
credit production obviously this is not strictly   true there's no like math to back this up but 
it's just like the mindset of the more discount   cards you can actually stack the better so 
for instance if you have Earth catapult and   anti-gravity technology then you have a discount 
of four on all the cards so this is like kind of   sort of like 16 Mega credit production but it's 
kind of impossible to evaluate because it depends   on so many things right it depends strictly on how 
many cards you play per generation for example if   you play exactly four cards per Generation Well 
then it is exactly like 16 Mega credit production   right but I would argue that if you're having a 
good game so in the mid to late game especially   this is gonna be way better than 16 Mega credit 
production so this is also where the card draw   element really comes in because you need card 
draw to get the best effect of these discounts   and it makes sense right because cards are just 
so efficient if they're 4 cheaper so you just   need as many cards as humanly possible so why am 
I saying that discount on cards actually Stacks   kind of sort of exponentially because the math I 
just laid out here doesn't really support that the   thing is if you're getting this much discount 
maybe more than likely you also have even more   discount on Space tags for example a lot of cards 
like you would never consider to play these cards   but if you have so much discount all of a sudden 
these cards are available plays to you so the   point I'm trying to make here is that if you have 
a lot of discount then all of a sudden these kind   of bad cards that you wouldn't normally buy out 
of the four cards in the research phase cards you   would normally maybe sell or something all of 
a sudden these cards become good especially if   we're talking about space tags because there's so 
many cards in this game that actually make space   tags cheaper like later in this video we're gonna 
look at a game where I literally have 17 discount   on Space tags and like I mentioned in the mid to 
late game I would argue that it is catapult and   anti-gravity technology is worth a lot more than 
16 Mega credit production just because in the mid   to late game if you have a lot of card draw you 
will be playing a lot more than four cards in the   last few generations and like I mentioned before 
discount on cards this is the special juice you   need when you're going GODMODE so the game on 
the mars app I talked about before this is the   starting hand I had and as you can see I have a 
lot of card draw I have a lot of Mega credits it's   kind of a good hand but it's not GODMODE because 
what am I missing? I'm missing Card discount I   have a little bit I have teractor I have mass 
converter but it's not enough I'm really missing   that special juice which is card discount but 
I'm getting it pretty early in this game so this   is why this game ends up being so good so real 
quick like I mentioned in the last episode this   is the best starting hand in existence I believe 
this best starting hand you can have ever however   this is like some user made cards so we're not 
going to talk about this today we are going to   talk about this hand and to be fair this is like 
entirely Theory craft I didn't actually have the   starting hand this is only me Theory crafting what 
is the best possible hand you can have so why is   this hand not as good as the other one where you 
use usermade card It's simply because there's a   little bit more card draw in the other hand and 
also they have Dew Wright and Dew Wright is like   Vitor but even better but this hand is of course 
still absolutely broken I'm gonna show you why so   there are actually three reasons why I decided 
to make this part two the first reason is that   out of an entire chapter about Synergy I kind of 
didn't feel like I talked enough about the best   Synergy in the game in my opinion which is this 
card draw Plus Card discount the second reason is   that while we talked a little bit about this hand 
in this previous video I didn't really explain to   you why this hand is so good and the third reason 
is I actually tried this in a Solo game and I was   like allright this is completely broken so I'm 
going to show you guys because it's actually a   lot of fun so even though this is Theory craft 
and you can argue well it has very little to do   with real terraforming mars because obviously you 
cannot use your starting hand there's still a lot   of the same Concepts that you can apply in your 
own game of terraforming mars if you will this   is just like an enhanced example where it goes 
completely GODMODE just so I can show you what   this can actually do when you get this synergy up 
and running the only weakness of this deck is that   the first couple of generations are kind of slow 
you can't really do much but that doesn't really   matter because by Generation 4 you're still gonna 
go GODMODE but a way you can address this issue of   having a slow start is just to remove AI Central 
and corporate archives and then you can substitute   these with supply drops and advanced Alloys 
and actually I think this is going to to be   a little bit better because you're going to have 
a way better generation one and two and then you   can you can start the snowball a lot sooner and 
you could go GODMODE maybe in generation three   instead of generation four but then you are of 
course losing AI Central and I think air Central   Drew me like eight cards in the game that I'm 
about to show you so it's not like the end of   the world but you're also losing one science 
tag so that Science Tag is pretty important   so you can play anti-gravity technology but to 
be honest this is not a problem at all because   all of this stuff that you're playing before 
you're playing anti-gravity technology just by   playing this stuff you will draw like 30 cards 
so one of these cards is gonna be a science tag   it's not a problem but that being said today we 
are gonna stick with AI Central plus corporate   archives because a little bit prettier that your 
starting hand has everything you need to play   anti-gravity technology all right but let's break 
down the starting hand why is this so completely   overpowered first of all I said this before but I 
think these are the three best card-draw cards you   can have Mars University Olympus conference and 
spin-off Department we have all of these three   cards in this opening hand so the arrows here like 
pinpointing to all of the stuff that gives card   draw so as you can see it's quite a lot so we also 
got corporate archives and AI Central and then   we've got Hi-Tech Lab and this card is also really 
good especially if you have Quantum extractor and   mass converter so you've got 10 energy production 
so every generation it's going to be a little less   than this because you also want to trade and stuff 
like this but you can tutor like seven cards and   just take one of these cards it's really good 
kind of the same effect as corporate archive so   if you look at it that way it's like really good 
and then we also got Point Luna which is also   perfect obviously because you're drawing a card 
every time you play an earth tag so just to give   you a frame of reference and the game I'm about to 
show you it's gonna be only seven generations but   in those seven generations Point Luna is gonna 
draw me 30 cards spin-off department where you   get a card every time you play a card with 20 
plus cost that's also gonna draw me 30 cards I   believe Mars University is also going to allow me 
to rotate 30 cards so it's completely insane just   compare that to AI Central which is a lot more 
expensive than Mars University AI Central only   gives me like eight cards this is why if you are 
gonna cut anything from the stick I believe it   should be AI central which kind of sounds crazy I 
know and also an important thing to realize about   all this card draw is that they're kind of 
boosting each other what I mean is like if you're   playing so many cards naturally you're gonna see 
more science tags you're gonna see more Earth tags   so the more card draw you have the better Point 
luna is the better Mars University is the better   Olympus conference is so if you're able to stack 
Card-draw like I'm doing here this is going to   make all the card-draw cards like exponentially 
better especially the card-draw cards which has   an effect like Point Luna spin-off Department 
Olympus conference Mars University all of these   are drawing you a card based off of something 
so if you're going GODMODE if you're having a   really good game this is like way more impactful 
than actually AI Central because AI Central is an   action you can only do that once per generation 
so these arrows here are looking at the card   discount and like we talked about Earth catapult 
and anti-gravity technology just this by itself is   insane then we also got Quantum extractor Mass 
converter and Valley Trust already now we have   8 discount on Space Tags and the effect of Valley 
trust where you get two discount on science tags   is not like the biggest deal in the world but on 
this hand there's already a lot of science tags so   it makes a lot of sense it's gonna give me a lot 
of value so this is why what I mean this is like   90 percent of the hand is card-discount and it's 
card-draw so there are actually only two cards we   haven't talked about yet and that's Vitor and 
orbital cleanup and these two is just to get a   little bit of money income because card-draw and 
card-discount that is the major component of this   but you also need a little bit of money income to 
actually get the full effect it makes sense right   so if you're going GODMODE Vitor is insane in the 
end of this video I'm gonna show you like some   stats based on this game I'm about to show you and 
Vitor seriously just generated me 222 Mega credit   during Seven Generations and orbital cleanup I 
think is also a necessity in this deck because   with all this science tag we are going to get 
Orbital cleanup can give you a lot of Mega credits   and also I has an Earth tag and also it's very 
cheap to play just because I have so much discount   on Space tags and Vitor so let's actually look 
at the card discount real quick so these are the   four cards with Card discount I already chose to 
have in my deck and also want to put some special   attention to these five cards I really hope that 
I would pick these five cards up like randomly   at the start of the game I ended up getting Sky 
Docks so that's kind of good but that is only one   out of five and then way later I got Media Group 
and that's a little bit too late but the reason   Media Group and optimal Aerobraking are so good is 
because it's not only discount they actually give   you stuff and you might be thinking well that's 
practically the same isn't it but it's not quite   because when you're having a lot of discount 
on Space tags and then you play some of these   cheap space Tags instead of it just being you can 
play it for zero then you actually get three Mega   credit when you play Space Tag so what I'm trying 
to say is when you're going full GODMODE actually   playing cards which ends up giving you stuff 
that's really good this is also the whole reason   I think meat Industries is so good when you're 
going GODMODE this can like generate you so much   gold and then finally before we look at the game 
I just wanted to mention these cards that just   straight up give you stuff it's like the same idea 
it's really strong to just get stuff especially   when you're going GODMODE so the game I'm about 
to show you I kind of played this deck like twice   but the first time I only played the first like 
three generations because in in generation three   I was going GODMODE and that's when I decided all 
right this this is crazy man I have to like just   restart this and just take some pictures and like 
document this stuff for you guys because this is   completely insane so this is why I restarted and 
then I went for it again but in the first game   I actually went kind of GODMODE on generation 
three the reason the first game was better is   that I picked up indentured workers and mineral 
deposit in the first or the second generation   and that just it makes me like get the snowball 
going like one generation before so I just wanted   to mention these cards these cards are really good 
so here we go let me show you how this deck can go   absolutely GODMODE in four generations and keep 
in mind this is not like a normal game where you   start with effectively 20 Mega credit production 
because you have 20 TR no this is like a solo game   so I only had 14 TR and then I have minus two Mega 
credit production to start the game with but even   that doesn't really matter much because I'm still 
gonna go GODMODE on Generation 4 so this really   hammers home the point I was trying to make before 
that is not all about Mega credit-production like   worth noting there's no mega credit production in 
this starting hand I have like two from spin-off   Department one from new partner and that's pretty 
much it then later on I'm even gonna lose two Mega   credit production Again by playing orbital 
cleanup so how on Earth is it mathematically   possible to go GODMODE on Generation 4 when I 
only have this little resources to begin with   so this is like the end of generation one and 
as you can see I didn't really do much I just   played spin-off department and then also played 
heavy Taxation and if you're wondering the two   cards I ended up keeping from corporate archives 
out of the seven cards I kept heavy Taxation and   energy market and Heavy taxation that's just a 
feel-good card at this point it gives me two Mega   credit production and one Mega credit for free 
kind of and then it's an Earth tag so it doesn't   really cost me a card because I'm just going to 
draw another card so it's just a feel-good card   at this point an energy Market does absolutely 
nothing for me right now but in Generation 3 I   believe I get Mass converter Quantum extractor so 
at that point it's gonna give me like eight for 7   generation (5 uses) still kind of good of course 
these two cards could have been something better   or something even more impactful but you know you 
get seven cards I just picked the two best here   and now get ready for the lamest thing you've seen 
all day so this is the end of generation one so   now I'm gonna show you the end of generation two 
ready voila absolutely nothing happens I simply   just passed the generation I didn't nothing so 
I only get 17 Mega credits I can't really do   much to be honest and of course the other reason 
I pass is that I want to play Earth catapult now   and Earth Catapult by itself doesn't really do 
anything so if I'm not planning to play something   after Earth catapult it's actually better to wait 
the generation because theoretically I could have   just top-decked Earth office or conscription or 
something like this so if that had happened and   I already played Earth catapult and generation 
two I would have been really salty so this is   why it's technically correct to only play 
Earth catapult the moment you plan on using   the discount effect the moment you plan on playing 
something else after Earth catapult and I will see   the change from the end of generation 2 to the 
end of Generation 3 and now stuff is beginning   to happen so now we're getting somewhere I 
can play Earth catapult Quantum extract and   mass converter and that also meant that I could 
finally play this energy market so I can transform   one energy production into eight gold which is 
really good for me right now and then of course   this is also the time to play Mars University 
and Olympus conference I believe I played these   before I played Quantum extractor Mass converter 
this is also a good time to play orbital cleanup   because I have a lot of science text now and 
also this card with all the discount I just   played is actually kind of cheap and seriously 
look at the discount here in Mars University for   instance Mars University cost exactly one because 
of Earth catapult Valley Trust and vitor and the   Olympus conference only cost me three Mega credits 
and it also god an Earth tag so it also draws me   a card so you can already see the Synergy really 
starting to take form here and then also picked   up some random pretty good cards here and like 
I'm saying when you're drawing this many cards   you are bound to find something some random card 
tha'ts really good for you so in this case Luna   Governor kind of cool because it has two Earth 
tags so it draws me two cards with Point Luna and   then I got interplanetary Colony Ship also a very 
good card at this point because I already have a   lot of space Tag discount and now I finally got 
my energy up and running so this means that I'm   actually able to trade in the Next Generation so 
now stuff is finally happening on the map so like   you can see I put it on Ceres and that's because I 
really want to trade on Ceres Next Generation and   that's gonna give me a lot so these are the three 
random colonies I got Pluto, Ceres kind of cool   Titan is gonna be completely useless so now let's 
look at the transition from end of Generation 3 to   end of generation 4 and worth noting in generation 
4 this is the first generation where I'm actually   trading so I'm also getting an extra trade fleet 
so this means that I'm trading on Ceres and on   Pluto so look at this jump here seriously end of 
Generation 3 and now look at end of generation 4   wow this is what I mean when I say that I feel 
like Generation 4 this is where I've truly gone   GODMODE I mean this is just beautiful so I really 
hope this Nails home the point that I'm trying to   make today that this card-draw Plus Card-discount 
combo that is so insanely good because once again   remember I started this game only having 14 TR and 
minus 2 mega credit production so started the game   effectively only having access to 12 Mega credits 
every generation and that's nothing so going from   that to this in only four generations that is 
completely insane so some of the cool stuff I   got in this generation I picked up warp drive 
and sky docs this is like maybe the best cards I   picked up right now also Advanced Alloys was a big 
one and then I got Luna metropolis and you might   be thinking oh man you're so lucky you got these 
cards but the thing is at this point I already   Drew like 100 cards so I think this game was 
like like average it's not like I was insanely   lucky this is just quite simply how this deck is 
going to play out every single time you can try   it yourself if you want to yeah I'm sure you're 
going to get just as good as a game as this one so   just to give you a little bit of fun stats right 
now when we're halfway through the game at this   point Mars University already allowed me to cycle 
15 cards Point Luna allowed me to draw 22 cards   and spin-off department has drawn me 8 cards and 
then thanks to the two cards I just picked up like   warp drive and sky docks now I have 13 discount 
on Space Tags so let's see what happened from   end of Generation 3 to end of generation 4 on 
the map so this is the first generation where   I actually traded it so as you can see I traded on 
Ceres and Pluto Ceres was like really good because   I ended up getting I think Spaceport Colony so 
I have actually two colonies in Ceres right now   so if you couple that with the fact that I 
also picked up Advanced Alloys that's like   effectively 30 buying power I'm getting here if I 
can use all of this steel so this is why I really   wanted to get a double colony on Ceres instead 
of Pluto it might look a little bit weird but   this is definitely worth it the rest of the game 
I'm just gonna speedrun a little bit because the   first few Generations those are actually the most 
like interesting to me a little bit so let's look   at the difference between end of generation 4 to 
the end of generation five and as you can imagine   as soon as you've hit this point in the game where 
you've gone complete GODMODE which I I would argue   is generation four then with generation five six 
and seven and then we're gonna close the game in   seven like just just by having three or four 
generations of complete GODMODE you can do so   much with this so I think you get the idea at this 
point the only thing I want to point out with this   generation is that I got a little bit of Green 
Tag Synergy decomposes Viral enhances venusian   animals is kind of cool and you might be thinking 
Venusian animals that should be impossible at this   point but here is how the map looked at the end 
of generation four and now look at the end of   generation five so when I picked up venusian 
animals I really tried to dedicate this whole   generation to just pumping the Venus up to 18 as 
much as I could because then I could play Venusian   animals and play some of the other science tags 
in my hand so let's go for end of generation 5   to end of generation six and yeah like I said at 
this point it's of course completely insane so   if we look at the map end of generation version 5 
compared to end of generation 6 now we're pretty   close to closing the game I think I could have 
actually closed the game in this generation if   I wasn't also focused on getting so many VP but 
of course I'm I'm a greedy person I also want the   VP and now finally the difference between end 
of Generation 6 to end of generation seven and   there you go this is like more cards than I play 
in a normal game of terraforming mars and finally   let's look at the map the end of Generation 6 
compared to the end of generation 7 as you can   see all the parameters has now been maxed out the 
board of the oxygen the temperature and also the   Venus and worth noting because I'm playing Venus 
and this is like a solo game I should have done   this solar phase or whatever it's called where 
I can World Government phase where I'm getting   one Terraform Rating for free every generation 
but I'm not getting it the world government is   actually getting it but this whole phase I didn't 
actually do it because I kind of forgot about it   now it's even harder for me to close the game but 
as you can see it's really not a problem I have   so many mega credits left over that even after 
closing all the parameters I still could like   fill up the map a decent amount with like cities 
and greeneries and stuff and also I want to point   out I didn't actually get a lot of asteroids 
I didn't get a lot of heat production I didn't   get a lot of stuff so I could actually close the 
temperature so I actually had to make a lot of   standard project with asteroids so like I think I 
made seven or eight so that's like more than 100   gold just to close the game with these stand-up 
projects and it still wasn't a problem because   I was so rich at the end of generation five so at 
the start of generation six I had 55 Mega credit   production and also have 45 TR so that's exactly 
100 Mega credits I actually got at the start of   generation six and then at the end of Generation 
6 I actually had like 144 Mega credits I believe   I got at the start of Generation 7 and here at 
the end of Generation 7 I'm at 85 TR and 120   Mega credit so if I played another generation I 
would have had more than 200 mega credits in case   you're wondering I kind of wrote down the score 
here I don't think it's important but just worth   noting Venusian animals decomposers those two 
popped off but that makes sense right because   I was able to play them so early and then I got 
three Jovian amplifiers and naturally with all   this discount on Jovian tags (space tags) is not a 
problem to play all of this Jovian stuff so that's   like a lot of points on Jovians as well and then 
you might be thinking I'm lucky that I got three   out of four Jovian amplifiers but I actually also 
like Drew three quarters of the deck so it makes   sense to be honest so it's 228 Victory parts and 
seven generations and and once again this doesn't   matter at all because this is I completely cheated 
I chose my own starting deck but I'm just it's   just to show you how strong this type of synergy 
can actually be but here are the fun stats this   is way more fun to talk about than actually the VP 
because this is like the fun stuff so here to the   left you can see the production I ended this game 
with the 30 titanium production that's a little   bit misleading because I actually didn't have that 
much titanium production it's just because in the   last generation I played this lunar Mining and 
I only played it like just because it's it's a   cheap Earth tag so I wanted another card that's 
pretty much it but now we get to the good stuff   156 cards played in this game and then I looked 
at around two thirds of the deck it's a little   bit less it was definitely more than half but the 
reason I look at so many cards that's because of   Pluto that's because of Mars University and it's 
also especially because of Hi-Tech Lab I ended   up having 17 discounts on Space tags and the 
Vitor Corporation actually ended up giving me   222 Mega credits in this game because I played 
74 cards wich actually had a positive Victory   on top of it and now look at this I drew 37 cards 
off of Point Luna I drew 30 cards off of spin-off   Department I was able to rotate 28 cards due to 
Mars University and then Olympus conference got   me 13 cards and then AI Central is actually a 
lot worse than the others because it only drew   me like 8 cards but just to defend AI Central a 
little bit here this is obviously because this   is a like a completely GODMODE game so it's not 
really a fair comparison normally AI Central is   actually also like almost as good as the other 
cards I would say but yeah that's pretty much   it for this video I hope this was still fun for 
you even though this is like a big Theory craft   and it's not necessarily something you would 
see in a real game but I still think the same   ideas apply to normal games like if you want 
to see a normal game where I also have a lot of   card draw and a lot of Card discount just watch 
the game I talked about before called the power   card draw I just really felt like I needed to make 
this video because I didn't really hammer home the   fact that I think card-draw plus discount-card 
is so good I hope at the very least you've gotten   that impression from this video that this type of 
synergy is really impactful and also Theorycraft   is fun man so in the last video I showed you the 
other Deck with like some user made content and   I said well if you want to you can see if you can 
come up with a better deck than that I'll give you   the same challenge for this video if you could 
come up with a fun deck that's almost as strong   as this one or maybe it's just fun in a different 
way it's very creative or something then feel free   to write it in the comments and I'll talk about it 
in the episode called feedback thanks for watching
