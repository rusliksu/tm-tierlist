Today we’re fortunate to have a highly skilled 
player, Boneless, here to share with us the top   10 strategy secrets to improve your Terraforming 
Mars game now. We’ll look at all the essentials   including card synergies, timing your play, 
how to leverage your engine, and the best   paths to generate high scores and devastate 
your opponents. This is Legendary Tactics.  Terraforming Mars is the #6 game on board 
game geek right now, and has consistently   ranked as one of the best 10 board games 
since its release in 2016. Last year we   met a talented Danish gamer and he’s back to 
teach us Terraforming Mars. Welcome Boneless: hello thanks for having me oh no problem well I 
could tell you're a man of skill when I spoke to   you about wingspan last year so I'm excited to 
see what strategies you offer us this year and   before we start our 10 strategy tips though I 
want to ask you why is it that you enjoy this   game so much it's uh my own personal favorite game 
I think it's so so deep it's like engine building   but like the best kind of engine building you can 
like go in and in like 10 different directions   and you have a new game every time and it's very 
satisfying oh that's perfect well we'll get into   that in detail very soon so let's start with our 
number one to begin I think we absolutely have   to talk about player count because in my mind the 
strategies of the game depend on how many players   are at the table so can you offer the major 
differences that we should consider depending   on how many players are playing yeah basically 
the game the way the way the game works is that   the the three parameters has to be satisfied so 
it doesn't even matter how many players you are   the three parameters still have to be satisfied 
so if you are in a five player games it tend   to be shorter in terms of generations because 
now there are five players eager to terraform   as opposed to like a two-player game then the 
game is gonna go a lot longer in terms of of   generations because now they're only two players 
to terraform everything all three air parameters   right this matters a lot actually because it 
means that in five player games you cannot get   away with so much greed you have to like really 
get your points pretty fast because you just have   fewer turns but in two player games it's uh it's 
much easier to just go for the big greedy engine   and a lot of card draw and make a ton of points 
this way right so there's sort of two different   approaches the short push or the rush versus 
the longer game and so in a higher player   count you're going to want to go with the shorter 
play style correct yeah as a rule yeah definitely   let's say the terraforming strategy let's call 
it this it's a it's much better in four or five   player games so what you do is instead of like 
getting a lot of a big greedy engine instead   of getting a lot of Mega credit production you 
still have to get a little bit but then what   you do is you get a lot of playing production 
heat production you just go for straight Tiara   like a lot of asteroids and stuff like this and 
you just try to get as many points as soon as   you can because the game is not going to be that 
long very nice let's move to our number two now   at the start of the game you get some choice 
about which Corporation to take in your mind   which ones have the best abilities and do you 
have success with any particular corporation um there's a lot of different corporations I think 
a lot of them are strong but basically what I'm   looking for initially is just what can give me the 
best the best amount of cards and mega credits and   steel and titanium right here right now and then 
can they effect be beneficial to me towards the   game and then we also back to like Play account 
because for example this Omni Corporation it's   it's one of the worst corporations in the game 
it's the one where you get if you made a tier of   this generation you can get one more TR for three 
Mega credits like this Corporation for example is   only good in four or five player games and even 
then it's questionable but it's just completely   unplayable in two-player games because it just it 
does so little for you so uh but it sounds like   it'll bleed your credits down too yeah but the of 
course some corporations are stronger than others   like there's a lot of good ones like if you're 
going for greedy game like veto or Point Luna   or manutech or something like this and even in 
shorter games these corporations are also solid   and then in five player games I I could tend 
a little bit more like I think thuses or maybe   Omni but even Omni is not that good there so I 
mean all you have to do is just look at your two   corporations look at your starting hand and also 
have the Play account in mind just figure out what   is best for you in this game that's great thank 
you very much well let's move to our third point   and this is I want to focus on the early game here 
and with most engine builders it's important to   get your economy up and running quickly so what 
thoughts do you have on how you should spend   your credits in the early game and when a player 
needs to focus on income generation well income   Generation Um if it's a long game and and you'd 
only really know if it's gonna be a long game it   can like shape out in a lot of different ways but 
generally speaking if it's a two or three player   game you know it's gonna be fairly long in terms 
of generation so in this case the best approach   by far is just to get some card draws and make 
a credit production some field production some   titanium production also TR to a lesser extent but 
mostly you're just looking for stuff you can build   a lot of cars with and then you look for a lot 
of card draw and if you can get these two things   running you can you can generate a lot of points 
in two play games is it effective to balance your   approach to this or do you tend to want to 
focus on one or the other of these resources um I think Mega critics is probably the strongest 
especially in these uh in these longer games even   in four or five player games I would still take 
the mega credit I can get in the early game like   if you start with the Quiet companies even in 
a five player game I'll still play that but   the the difference is in the five player game you 
also heavily relying on like straight TR or heat   production plan production something like this 
I mean in in two or three player games it's all   about the the greedy card strategy you just have 
to get a bunch of cards a bunch of income and uh   then you go for the long game so how do you decide 
specifically which cards to take in those early   rounds and how many cards to take is that based on 
their cost more or is it based on the value that   they add to your game or to your engine for me I 
look at all the options I have and I wonder should   I save my money or should I be spending it what's 
your advice there well first of all you should be   spending your mega credits it's a it's a generally 
it's pretty bad to just pass the generation with   20 Mega credits if you're doing this it's only 
because you have like an expensive card like   iron mining Industries or some some other really 
expensive car that you want to play the following   generation so basically you want to invest your 
your cards as soon as possible yeah all right so   I'd like to ask you about those starting cards 
in the starting hand what would you say is the   ideal cost for cards that you're picking up early 
on when you don't have much of an engine built   um basically you want the cards that can 
pay for themselves in the shortest amount   of generations like a card like immigration 
shuttles this takes a little more than I   believe six generations to pay for itself 
it costs 30 plus three for the card and it   gives you like five Mega credit production so 
it could be tempting to look at this card but   but this is almost too expensive but 
you're really searching for is like   uh I guess acquired companies or some of these 
uh a bit cheaper like a credit production   um cards nice but yeah as a general rule you 
want cards that can pay for themselves in five   or fewer Generations um otherwise it's not really 
worth it but basically you just have to play the   best cards that are available available so you 
have to play with the cards you get obviously   that's great okay well let's move on to our 
fourth strategy tip and part of the beauty of a   game like terraforming Mars is reading the options 
presented to you and choosing the best pathway so   I'd like to ask you what are the main options or 
synergies that a player can focus on when they're   deciding which project cards to pursue or perhaps 
I should ask what are the primary and best paths   to victory in this game this is a huge question 
I know I'm sorry for such a big one no I mean   you're completely right synergies is like a big 
part of it so the biggest type of synergies in   this game is pretty much like cop discount so if 
you have some cop discount of a different variety   obviously you you are trying to guide your game 
in that direction but it's also like when you get   your corporation if your corporation is like 
Poseidon then you're more inclined to go for   colonies if you're a corporation is classes you're 
more inclined to go for cities there's a lot of   City Synergy in this game so if you get a few of 
these combo pieces let that like boost your cities   immigrant City or Martian rails or something like 
this then of course you maybe just go over cities   this game um so so Synergy is like a huge part 
of it there's a lot of different synergies but   but mainly in the early game in the opening hand 
I think the Synergy that that I look for first of   all is like what can give me the most to make a 
credit and card draw can I can I go for this card   strategy so to speak others although synergies 
could be like a talk about the city Synergy is   a big one it would also be something simple like 
do I have some a little bit of heat Synergy heat   production is is way better if you have like just 
a little bit of of stuff that can um um like some   of these discount cards are really good with the 
heat production for example but it could also just   be the case that you have boost for heat there's 
also this card that can turn five feet into three   steel or something like this right away so yeah 
Heats energy serious energy and it it could be   a variety of other things that well to me that's 
what makes a really good game is that you can't   just pick one strategy that's why I love Puerto 
Rico because there's lots of different ways to   win and that's why I don't love Agricola because 
it's it's a very balanced you you can't just focus   so that's very cool well moving on to our number 
five one part of the game that I love is that the   game gives you a goal and it just offers you 
a huge tool kit with which you can reach the   goal and it lets you figure out how to get there 
so at what point should you start thinking about   other tools in your kit like milestones and 
awards is this an early mid or late game Focus um Milestones is uh I hate to keep beating this 
horse but it really depends the number of players   like Milestone and five player games is like an 
actual race you just have to get the Milestone   as soon as possible and then it's like gradually 
changing like four player is also pretty important   three players then I'm not really uh I mean you 
should also you should always have milestones in   mind you should always try to get one of them and 
when you look at the starting hand this is also   one of the things you should be planning ahead 
slightly but it's not like a race to get all the   Milestone as soon as possible because then you're 
just completely destroying your own game it has to   be one of the Milestones it's like come naturally 
to you right in two player games it's uh it's it's   really not that important like it could even be 
generation six or seven or something before you   even consider milestones in a two-player game 
but that being said they are of course they are   of course really nice it's getting five victory 
points for only eight even though you have to get   it this early it's still very efficient but just 
just don't buy three standard project cities just   so you can get the major Milestone it's really 
not worth it you have to take the Milestones   that are naturally on your path gotcha okay yeah 
that is reminiscent of wingspan it's those end of   round bonuses right exactly yeah yeah that's 
very cool Awards you also asked about Awards   yeah those are late game push through I think the 
three Milestones are usually to be taken first you   can also start the first award if you're right 
really confident that you're gonna win it but   you really have to be confident if if there's at 
least like if you're not sure you're gonna win it   it's actually not worth it to start it so early 
but the first one of course it's only eight so   you you could argue that one could be played in 
the early to mid game but the one that costs 14   and the one costs 20. this is mid to late game 
uh I would even sometimes I wait until the last   generation before I even think about getting the 
one that costs 20. um because the thing is it's 20   make a credit and then you get Five Points that's 
kind of good but the math doesn't really stop here   because then you're also feeding a second place 
to your opponent and most importantly it could   also be the case that someone just surprises 
you with a card or something and then you yeah   then you are not even getting first place in that 
award so you really have to be careful with these   Awards they can they can lose you the game if 
you've spent 14 and 20 and then your opponent   like stealing these two Awards away from you then 
you lost the game oh shoot okay well let's move on   to number six this is opponents and timing I want 
to talk about here uh this isn't really a game in   my opinion where you can just put your head down 
and focus on your own board so I wonder to what   degree do you pay close attention to what your 
opponents are doing and then change the timing   of your play based on what they're doing yeah um 
this is of course really important the The General   idea of this game is that if you are having the 
greedy the best engine if you're having like the   best game you got a lot of Mega credit a lot of 
uh card draw then it's in your if you are the big   horse if you if you're the guy who got all the 
stuff then it's your opponents really should be   closing the game sooner uh because then like if 
you're going for the terraforming strategy you're   gonna make a lot of points in the early game the 
mid game in the late game if you're going for   the big greedy engine then you're getting nothing 
in the early to mid game then you're only making   point in the late game so this is what's really 
important for like the terraforming strategy to   like close the game as soon as possible to to 
Really punish the greedy guy because in the late   game you cannot you cannot win against the guy 
who got all the cards and all the engine so your   only option is to to close the game at this point 
right okay are there any other counter strategies   specific strategies you could offer so for example 
if a player is placing Greenery tiles what can   you do to disrupt that and I should ask you to is 
turn order important in terms of who's going when   yeah let's take the first one first um if if 
you're talking greeneries you're probably also   talking cities um because I think these two things 
are really linked so in order to disrupt the city   guy you could do a few different things first 
of all the easiest thing you can do is just play   cities in a daily cards yourself like if you're 
against passes and he's building a lot of cities   just play pets just play Immigrant City because 
this way he can still play cities if he wants   but but when he does he's also going to feed you 
make a credit and and victory points if you play   pets so that's the easiest way to counter 
it the other thing you can do is just play   exactly like one or two cities during the game 
and preferably like in the middle of this Empire   um it also depends how many plant production you 
have yourself but you don't really have to have   more than one or two cities if you're playing 
against us it's fine as long as you put it in   the middle of his Empire somewhere uh to be really 
annoying and then he's kind of got in that case he   has to like give you Mega credit or give you 
free VP because you're playing next to his uh   his greeneries and and even if it's if it's in the 
middle of his Empire sooner or later he will have   to have greeneries because it's also going to like 
touch his own cities and then you're gonna get   some some victory points for free right there's a 
good thing you can do to counter fast this is all   of these special times and it's the same idea as 
just placing a city in the middle of the Empire   you could just like achieve a lot of those special 
tiles and just be a little terrorist and just be   really you know that's awesome and what about 
turn order yeah do you pay attention to that   much yes turn order is actually really important 
it's it's important when it comes to bonuses it's   important when it comes to a lot of different 
things um so if I know that I'm gonna start   the next generation and I also in this generation 
maybe because I I only took one action on my turn   or something then I'll have a lot of actions in 
a row and that can actually be really impactful   um for example you can use this if you get like 
four or five actions in a row you can you can use   it to to just claim a bonus or set yourself up to 
claim like both the bonus on the oxygen scale and   maybe also the water it's really funny when this 
happens it's like it's really game changing if   you can get set yourself up to get both of these 
bonuses for example it's also like if you know   that you're gonna start the next Generation you 
can really plan all right can can I just be greedy   and wait until the start of the Next Generation 
before I actually buy the Milestone or the award   I want because if if you learn to take into 
account the player order then you can use this   to to to actually maximize your efficiency so 
instead of just all right I I have three cities   now no claiming mayor you could just wait until 
the next generation for example that makes sense   that's awesome so for our seventh strategy I'd 
like to move to the mid game and this is after   you've got your foundational engine you've got 
your trajectory in the game figured out and   since the game ends when Mars is terraformed it's 
important that players pay attention to how slowly   or quickly this is happening so what ideas would 
you offer on one knowing when you want to move   the game more quickly by advancing those tracks 
and two how to slow down or speed up the game   yeah in terms of speeding up the game then we're 
back to the thing we talked about before like if   the opponent is is the greedy guy with the 
bigger that that's often me actually yeah so   if I have the big engine that'd be a lot of card 
draw then my opponents should should do what they   can to close the game and once again this is like 
a lot more plausible in four or five player games   in two player games I mean my one opponent and 
two player he can terraform as much as he wants   he's still not gonna close the game that soon in a 
two-player game so so it's definitely more a thing   in four or five player games but that being said 
like if we're getting like the generation seven   or something and and even in a two-play game if 
you can see that your opponent all right he still   has 20 cards I have two cards then of course it is 
still in your best interest to to try to to close   the game to especially if you feel like you're 
hit right now but later on you're definitely gonna   gonna struggle then of course you wanna close 
the game that's great and what was the second   part of your question uh the second part was how 
you slow down or speed up the game are there do   you have any clever ways to do that Beyond just 
the you know advancing the track more quickly or   yeah in two three player games you can actually 
artificially make the game longer this this is   like one of the really annoying little strategies 
you can do but what you can do is you can just you   can just not spend your heat like you you try to 
like identify the last parameter that is if needed   to close the game and then there's never terrify 
that right yeah you're not helping with with the   terrifying uh because in this case it's uh yeah so 
so if you have protected habitat what I've done a   few times is that I just keep all my plans I just 
don't don't use my plans for a long time and then   I make sure that the game goes to like 11 12 or 13 
or even 14 sometimes you can also do it with heat   yeah like just and and the little side bonus is 
that for example with heat you can just if you   do if you did this and then you you can see all 
right now the heat is kind of close to to being   closed then you can use all of the heat you have 
maybe in the in and yeah you can use a lot of the   heat you have to to claim the the bonus because 
you just stacked up so much of it so it's also a   way to get like the water bonus on the on the heat 
scale and also if the parameters close to closing   of course you want to be using all of the the 
heat to get the last few available here but the   sometimes it matters more that you are efficient 
and just spend your plans and your heat because   this also gives you terraform rating so it also 
like helps build your engine a little bit and   sometimes it makes a huge difference that you 
just hook back these resources because it could   be the difference between going to to generation 
I don't know 10 or 11 and in the 11th generation   you're going to make so much points if you are the 
greedy guy so so in this way you can also prolong   the game it's really annoying but it can be really 
effective that's brilliant I love it so moving on   to our eighth strategy we also need to discuss 
standard projects so are they worth the high   cost are they useful when should you be thinking 
about these and would you consider these primarily   endgame moves or when what's the best time to 
play them um first of all if you have standard   technology a lot of the standard projects are 
just solid just by themselves so so let's get that   out of the way but let's assume you don't have 
standout projects or standard technology I think   it's called this card that makes standard projects 
cheaper right but the in the early game I mean   if you're playing with colonies then the colony 
standard project is really good it's really   good in the early game if you you can use like a 
Luna Pluto a series or something that gives you   a decent amount of money income or something 
like this so so I think the the build a colony   standard project is really good it's good in the 
early game and in the mid to late game it can also   be really strong to put it on on the Miranda or 
the Titan the one with lotus or something like   this insulators it can be really strong but the 
the um the the power plant I believe it's called   um that one is uh it's it's I mean if you need it 
you need it it's uh you don't really want to just   take build three power plants just so you can 
like trade for instance but the um but if you   have like two energy production then it's a really 
good play to just buy the power plant to get the   last few energy production you need and then you 
can then you can trade for instance like if you're   playing with colonies but even with you if you're 
not playing with colonies if you need desperately   need a stand-up project the energy production then 
it's fine just don't just don't just don't do it a   lot of times because generally the the way the 
game works is that cards are more efficient so   standard projects it's something you you do if 
you have to but but you kind of hope that you   get a card that can do this for you but maybe you 
don't have the right card for the right situation   so they can fill in the gaps in your life I fill 
in the gaps yeah for sure okay and then we got the   if if you're playing Venus there is this uh for 
15 I I don't remember what it's called but you   can increase Venus One Step there's also this 
asteroid where you can increase the heat one   step and these two are terrible they're they're 
really they're really bad you only use these if   you you really have a clear purpose maybe you 
have like a venusian animals you'll need to pump   up the Venus a little bit or if you're trying to 
lose on purpose then you could use those yeah I   guess or maybe if you can get the the bonus like 
if you have eight heat if they're two steps to   the water bonus on the temperature scale and you 
have eight heat then of course you you use eight   heat and then you also buy one asteroid just so 
you can get that extra water right because then   you pay 14 to get a water and the temperature 
then it's good but the general rule you want   to stay away from those there's also like if once 
again if you're really trying trying to close the   game if your opponent just has the greedy engine 
and heat is the last one to to to close then it's   also completely fine to maybe pay for the last 
four heat just so you can or play the asteroid   standard project four times just so you can close 
the game in this case it could also be be good   moving on to number nine how much of this 
game is dependent on its style placement or   on the Tactical level of the game and when you're 
placing City and green tiles is there a particular   place or a certain way that you suggest doing 
this when it comes to playing tiles in general   um there's this pattern where you you place your 
cities and then you place the next city so that it   can be like two greeneries in between your cities 
right so it's almost like this uh this pattern   with triangles if you know what I mean yeah so 
that's the first thing but other than that I think   cities should be placed in a way so they have a 
space for a lot of greeneries around them and also   if they're already greeneries on on the on the 
map then of course it's it can be good to place   it next to those greeneries um and then you want 
to place it in a way so you can you can be next to   one water or something if you want but but it's 
better to to be like in the middle and then you   have greeneries and all of these greeneries they 
can touch the water so you can get a lot of water   bonus adjacency by placing your greeneries next 
to the water but your Series has to be preferably   a little more in the middle so there can be 
fiber or six greeneries around them when the   game is done very cool now what about edges do 
you want to have any tiles there or is there   ever a time to play around the edges of the I 
just count how many greeneries can be around   them so if if there are no of the really good 
spots left then you can only place it on the   edge well and just count how many greeneries 
can be around it is there some water close by   some other resources a card I can take into 
account or something okay does it affect the   the Milestones or the awards especially like on 
the Hillis and Elysium map there there can be   a lot of strategy where you put your tiles in 
this case if you're going for the uh what's it   called desert settler or the the estate dealer 
or something like this but the placing it on   the edge of the map is okay if you have nothing 
better but of course if you're placing it on the   edge of the map is probably only a room for four 
greeneries around it right it could be better   so for strategy tip number 10 one Mantra or 
philosophy I've heard for terraforming Mars is   that like the Kildeer and wingspan forests win 
games because they give you two points at the   end they raise your income they score proximity 
bonuses and they essentially pay for themselves   really cheaply so do you agree with this 
assessment I think brand production is really good   for sure the way I like to do it the way I think 
you should do it is in the first generation and   the on the opening hand and stuff like this you 
can keep playing production card in your hand but   really what you want before you start doing this 
is you want to get your engine up and running so   so just spending the first generation only playing 
brand production that's usually not good enough   but assume if we hit the early to mid game I think 
plan production is really good um I don't agree   that you just I think it killed yet in wingspan is 
a lot better than than just having greeneries in   terraform Mass like ecoline it's a it's a fine 
Corporation but it's not Orwin it's it's it is   it's like only an average corporation like uh it's 
more important there's so many different things   you can do um but The Greener is only at series 
is only like a part of it but uh once again we   come back to the number of players because always 
it's good to have plant production but the cities   and plans if you want to go all in on this then 
it's better to do that in four or five player   games uh in in like in two player games or three 
player games usually the greedy guy especially the   greedy guy with the card strategy who just has 
a big engine and a lot of cars it's usually way   better than placing cities and greeneries but once 
again you have to play the the cards you've been   dealt like if you've even in a two or three player 
game if you've been dealt fastest with immigrant   City and you have some playing production maybe 
it's something like this then of course you go   for it but the generally speaking I I think cities 
and greeneries are slightly better in four or five   clipping games okay well despite my best efforts 
I simply couldn't get the core strategies into 10   points so we'll offer a bonus value tip here and 
I'd like to ask you if you reflect back on all   the times you've won this game where would you 
say the majority of your points have come from um that's easy uh I enjoy greedy 
games so it definitely definitely uh   cards because that's basically what the Greely 
card strategy is right you just you just have a   lot of cards and then you get a ton of points 
you get them from jovians you get them from   the number of your car on the number of the 
actual cards when you're done with the game   you get it and all the stuff you have on top 
of your cards so especially green tax energy   that's that's a way you can make like a ton of 
points in this game um so so me personally I   think these games are a lot more fun so so this 
is uh what I would aim to do and I think if you   add a two or three player game I think this is 
actually the best approach to the game but if   we're talking four to five player games um then 
it's it's it's just as good maybe even better   to just go for terraforming or go for cities or 
something like this cities can be okay in two or   three play games but I think that this trade-off 
terraforming strategy that that's just not gonna   cut it in two or three player games I don't think 
yeah so so button for five player games just just   terraforming like crazy try to close the game 
as soon as possible that that's really good and   especially if I play games very nice now out of 
curiosity do you have a favorite card in the game   pets has got to be up there well it pets pets 
do you like pets yeah pets pets is fun um also   Penguins uh I like me some penguins nice uh it's a 
nice card in terms of power level it's uh there's   some cards that you're just you just know that 
these cards you're always happy when you see them   um it could be like a advanced Alloys or 
that's like so you got Olympus conference   you've got Martian University and also you 
got this card um it costs 10 gives you two   Mega credit production and then you can draw 
a card every time you play a card with 20   plus cost I mean these three cards also Stella 
these are always really good that's fantastic   wonderful well if players want to go into 
more depth to I understand you're you're   in the middle of releasing a series of videos 
on terraforming Mars and I think you explore a   lot of these issues we've talked about today am I

it's usually way too big for for people's liking   but there's like yeah I made a lot of videos 
on my on my Channel It's gotta be I don't know   20 hours of content just for a terraformal 
strategy guide so it's uh it's definitely in   depth go big or go home so we'll link to that in
