So that's ehh Anthracite comments on your
stream and I don't see it and I... it's up to you I really don't care both is fine okay
it's just for learning it's all good okay I think it should be working now yeah so I don't have that many events I only
have mineral deposit I'm feeling like helion probably uh Anthracite isn't commenting so I will what's
your second corp choice it's um the interplanetary cinematics okay both are good corps it will
depend on your starting hand yeah I don't have that much... yea it should be Helion
what yeah it should be helion unless you have great
buildings tags here yea I don't yeah this is an easy Helion for me yeah seems
like it's a decent hand you can keep this noctis is always a keep
in starting hand Noctis city yeah why though why do you guys like this
city and not other cities it's insane because it has a reserved spot yeah and uh usually
a lot of Greeneries are coming down in the west especially when you're ecoline so if
your opponent is ecoline you can usually get a five-point noctis during the game or uh
and uh it's a it is um it gives us two plants it gives uh two rebates it's just a very good
card and it's it's uh it's worth keeping on the other Maps it's less interesting obviously
but on this one it's just it's just good it's always a keep uh what is what are your first
five cards you can keep noctis farming as well so this Mining rights and noctis large Convoy
mineral deposits is probably all I'm keeping yep feels good it's interesting uh am I playing
noctis anytime soon no I don't think so so the energy production from Martian Industries
is not that huge right well biosphere is a bad prelude but uh here you seem to have a
rush set up right yeah you will have four heat prod from the get-go you need plans to
supplement that I personally would go Biosphere but if you want to go biolab that's actually
not terrible Martian Industries is the one I would not take in this situation it's very interesting you guys want to keep
Noctis city without energy production all right yeah because it's a it's the last gen
play usually Noctis city is the last gen play so you have plenty of time to find energy
and it's pretty much a card that is almost always worth it unless the opponent goes a
long way to uh to put uh random tiles that are not greeneries next to noctis [Music] all right so like this looks good yeah I think
that's decent yeah that is true actually AAA wouldn't be
that bad AAA is a arrow-break ammonia asteroid that
is really would you consider this three heat prod and one plant prod it's not horrible
when you know you have to rush uh here it would probably be worth it yeah I never thought this card was playable it
is playable sometimes not often but sometimes it is would you play gen 1 power plant carbonate
in adapted lichen yeah yeah definitely if the answer is yes then you play AAA [Music] I 
have a play here I can do um can I do standard project mineral deposit
Mining rights what is this 14 19 standard projects what standard project do you want
to do Greenery no I'm thinking standard project asteroid to get the heat pump and then I can
Mineral Deposit Mining rights it's not worth it the heat will be will be flying anyways
because I have heat production myself well it you haven't seen what I will play next
but uh I assure you heat will be flying and so what you want to do is definitely not SP
asteroids in this case it's too secure ground whoever wins the ground wins the game here
so you don't want to spend your precious cash on SP asteroids especially so the question is where I put the Mining
rights then are thinking here at the uh Pavonis is usually best choice is obviously it's usually
the best choice unless you have absolutely no titanium and uh a lot of Steel plays yeah would have skipped the crap out of AAA
gen 1 um I'm not feeling the AAA either but uh I'll probably pass here I don't know what
crap he's talking about though because you didn't keep that many cards and the card you
kept were good oh [ __ ] he said he would have skipped the crap to play AAA oh interesting
really Anthracite you would have skipped Noctis uh oh wow gen one AAA I have never even could
imagine this is a thing you would do interesting holy [ __ ] I have a I have a big decision
here Anthracite I'm leaning towards Card 1 but uh I probably need to go Plantation for you do you have do you have science tags
played already uh everything looks bad to be honest but I think Plantation is slightly
better than artificial Lake artificial Lake will certainly be playable that's for sure
in this game but uh yeah the problem is that you have no tag for Plantation it it will
probably be good but uh you cannot be certain it will artificial Lake will always get value
but it's usually pretty marginal Plantation could be good I think I would take Plantation
in your shoes and hope that you find science tags yeah Anthracite which card would you
take here I I think I will take uh third one uh yep yeah to answer anthracite I think uh
I I just thought AAA was all was like way too expensive for what it gives you I never
thought it was a good card but interesting that he would go for it well you're not answering my question uh you
said yeah you're throwing some meth at me no I'm asking if you would play power plant
carbonate and adapted Lichen on gen 1 uh I think power plant Carbonate would be a kind
of weak play but uh I think your point is that this is the same cost as a why is this
why is this a weak play explain it's too expensive no? why come on you just you're just saying
that like Carbonate it's just bad card I don't understand With Power Plant it doesn't feel that strong
to me but I guess I'm not valuing heat production power plant seven bucks for an energy production
yeah Power Plant is one of the cheapest ways yeah okay I tohught you meant Standard Project
Power Plant no no no no no with Standard project power it's it wouldn't be horrible actually
for carbonate gen 1 but uh it wouldn't be exciting but uh yeah with power plants I'm
talking about the card playing 7 for an energy paying 9 for carbonate paying 12 for adapted
Lichen this is 28 for a three heat prod and one plant
prod and yet you say you can't understand AAA yeap I guess you have a point I just never thought
AAA would be a good card I thought it was too expensive for what it gives you in those
Ultra Rush games where you know you have to rush it is a good hmm but still I like noctis
and deposits so yeah so what about here by the way my time is running I'm thinking restricted
area but is this too greedy do I need to go for cloud seeding no no Cloud Seeding is bad
uh Cloud Seeding could be marginally good in this game but it is always I mean you want
to talk about a card that's never worth playing it's Cloud Seeding okay AAA is good Cloud
Seeding is one of the worst cards in the deck probably it could be playable here if oceans
were if if we had three oceans here I would play Cloud Seeding in this game I wouldn't
so I think I'm keeping Plantation here just hoping I get some Science tags at least I mean I have one with Restricted
Area so I think large Convoy convert is probably
the best I got no restricted area I guess Large Convoy converts a very weak
play it's basically a standarding a Greenery here
yeah plus if you play large Convoy convert then
he just puts an ocean down and takes the Four pocket it's really bad yeah if you play large Convoy here I will
cut you off from Ocean walking North which is uh which is really bad uh and uh
also you want to develop your card draw as fast as possible to try to outscale Ecoline
because uh I'm a threat in the short game allright and you're building towards a short
game so you want to give yourself chances to find outs either card or one plant in the
standard e-spot yeah I'm thinking card because my hand is so unplayable right now I kind
of like the e-spot versus Both are fine both are fine like yep the normal Eastern City Spot one
plant in the east yeah all right we try it and that actually is quite painful to me because
I intended to play research outposts there right now so I will have to play it next to
noctis because I don't know you have noctis but well I I know you have Noctis but even
if I didn't I would have played it there [Music] so I can either pass or I can speaking of
Carbonate processing this is the play I thought you were talking about going actually and
actually I misplayed this this very hard anthracite should be pulling his hair out I should have
claimed the spots next to your restricted area and kept uh kept research Outpost as
a Teleport my mistake yeah I like Comet Comet and convert next to restricted uh me No we just pass you don't wanna you
won't want to do this standard power plant and carbonate processing no it's really bad
yeah I agree uh this is what I thought you were saying uh before in chat it would be
good gen one if you were controlling the heat track but right now pushing the heat track
the difference is seven and eleven is huge difference on gen 1 yeah yeah and playing
a gen one versus gen two right yeah I misunderstood your writing before I thought this is what
you meant so I could maybe just risk yeah I think it looks okay right of course I actually could play IO mining Industries
here he can as well but I guess it's a very short game so it's probably not this card
is probably one of the worst cards this will wheel back to you I'm leaning towards card for myself here passing
card 2 could be dangerous okay well so Mass converter or giant space mirror both
of them are not that useful but I guess it's dangerous to give him Mass Converter what
do you think I'm never going to play mass converter probably but I have two science
already I could play it that's true but uh GSM since he has just titanium floating yeah
that's a good point because you don't know he has a target for
it but and then you take the power I guess since I have nothing to do I might
as well play this well I mean you're working your way towards
your first card now um the power I would take one of the Power Cards just like this one and two yea No my plants go ahead and draw [Music] maybe slightly better than this maybe both I would develop giant space mirror and carbonite all right [Music] so you wouldn't play this at all I guess no
would you play this might as well nope wouldn't play wouldn't play anything you wouldn't I
wouldn't yeah I would pass as well if I was if yeah if I was in your shoes you have no
interest to pay to to play anything here Noctis farming is not something you want to play
unless it gives you an instant conversion here it just makes your plants vulnerable
and uh you want to try to find parts of the bio combo before you play it cards like viral
enhancers decomposers ecozone yeah but well first of all I have nitrogen Rich Asteroid
right I have to play some plant tags and also I could convert with Noctic city next turn
if I wanted to no like how with ehh Noctis farming now and then I get the some plant
prod the ocean yeah it feels bad to me and the conversion no Noctis City is an extremely
weak play right this is where yeah this is terrible to play both both of these cards
are I mean the only reason you would even think about Noctis Farming is because you
have NRA but there's so many more synergies that you can find like Ecozone viral Etc and
there's no you're not very unlikely to want to convert by picking up a plant on the board
at the beginning of the next gen so you're just gonna float seven plants as well um this
I don't understand you cannot I can 100 convert right if I do Noctis Farming and then Noctis
city convert but Noctis city is a terrible play right you don't want to commit yourself
to making that play okay right this is the problem Noctis City basically delays NRA by
at least one gen if you play that it costs you a generation in production to play Noctis
City all right so just pass here or do I Heat no no I would pass [Music] everything you
organize around NRA now right this is the card you want to get down as quickly as possible
so you take protected Valley yeah but in that case uh this plant tag is yeah all right nothing of this is good I think lunar beams
very weak I would take GHG bacteria especially since you passed him Mass So do I play it or no no no we don't play
it it's a better card for him and take the two cards for him that's irrelevant huh and so we take protective Valley yeah that's
probably all um yeah I'm wondering here Anthracite if you were
me would you pick Luna Beam no if it was gen 3 I would but here I think it's
a bit too late and this is probably quite weak as well I wouldn't bother now you just draw this is looking good for you boneless because
uh um I don't have much to do yeah I can protected
valley let's think here so what I'm just thinking we have 41 51 56 cash so you don't we can't quite get NRA down here
no but I can protected Valley Noctis farming convert and then do this next gen I think I play protected Valley in the middle
of the board yeah right here yeah yeah but it's so weird to me this thing about
I thought it was very important for you guys to protect your plants right now I'm vulnerable
to to plant hate but if I played this noctis farming last gen I would be yeah yeah no I
mean it worked out the way that you were describing but like there are very this is basically
the only card that you would find that you'd want to play that wouldn't give you a conversion
anyways all right and if you like it's not really that important to work around Plant
hate because you're always going to get hit by it no matter when you play it huh so I
got my plant burned but I still play should I just not play it and just play it next gen
yeah no no I would just pass again all right [Music] over this how many building tags does he have? 3 probably
medical lab but yeah this is pretty bad this yeah you just take the gas right yeah not even
bother with Mining Expedition no doesn't really do anything all right yeah looks good [Music] now we draw Standard Tech is interesting now play Noctis
Farming [Music] yep it's good [Music] I was thinking a brief second about the medical
lab and then going for Builder but I'm sure that you wouldn't approve hehe let's look
at the cards you would have to play to get that yeah it would be terrible I mean I'm not gonna lie I would have been
tempted to play industrial microbes early in the game but I am for sure underestimating
how fast this game is going to be I it's probably my issue I mean the most important thing is to get NRA down
as quickly as possible so we're really close to doing it last gen it wouldn't have been
close if you played microbes yeah this is also my second Science Tech for the
plantation if I want to yeah that's true [Music] oh yeah I still have 24 gold here I mean in Theory I could play standard Tech
Plantation if I want to I know I can actually play this I don't think there's a purpose well hang
on yeah that's there is a way where I can work towards the yeah now I think I would
just take the bonus ocean wow you can take the bonus ocean well not
right now right I have to wait until next gen but no can I take it now? what am I missing
no I mean I would just take I mean probably sell microbes yep a big asteroid
oh yeah you have 24 heat I missed it it's okay sell microbes and take it Just Slam Big Asteroid? no no no no no because
then he can just take 1 heat bump and pass okay so you don't mean I can get it now but
in the start of the Next Generation I can get it is that what you mean yeah exactly
okay I was confused all of this looks so I just pass well here's
the question is do we want to play against (no idea what he said lol) probably I think
so at the start of yeah I mean I could at the start of the next gen I can burn a lot
of his plants either way so I think we pass yeah I think you got this unless I have crazy draws
I'm not going to win it [Music] For sure Algea right? no no no no that's dead
yeah I think Anti-grav uh or how many science tags does he have I just checked I don't think
either of us have any yes I have 2 I have 2 that's 1 I also have 2 with this so do I
think I take I'll take anti-grav yeah all right that's actually hang on wayowayo stop that stop Also Herbivores uhm I mean Mars U is not doing that much here Take Herbivores do we take Herbivores? we have a lot of plant production so it makes
sense to me yeah I mean it's close yeah I mean I think Herbivores is better so I don't think I keep anti-gravity but the question is do I keep wave power no
but I would take herbivores and Mars U here oh he gave this back to me holy hell Mars
U fourth pick what game are we playing yea I thought it would be impossible do I take
it? yea I'd hit him with big asteroid yea [Music] Do I take plants or two cards or Titanium
I think I'll take that plants no two plants next to uh not uh not that one but the one
next to your protective Valley yeah that one but yeah [Music] [Music] oh hang on hang on let's see let's
just think here yes uh first of all there is an argument to be made that I take the
heat bonus so he doesn't get it at the start of the next gen but I'm not sure no no no
no no the only thing that matters right now is terraformer well that would be another
reason to do my thing like two plants two conversions two of those just look at your
hand real quick look at your hand I only need three points to get it yeah I know I'm just
you want to think about the right sequence here I think you go uh Plant conversion on
two plants and heat bump yeah so he doesn't get the bonus right um think about your cash
here so um yeah playing conversion on two plants and
two cash yeah maybe yeah I mean I go to the left of his tile yeah I'm just thinking out
loud here um if I convert now immediately I can take the last bump and then uh you're
afraid he's gonna take no no no no no you you can't take both heat pumps because then
you can't afford a fun terraformer no but you need to it's just the the order of which
you do things it's a little bit safer for my plants to use them immediately but I guess
if you haven't no it's not because then then you won't get terraformer because he just
SPS two asteroids and you can't get terraformer hmm yep let's see so you convert I would convert
to the left no on Southeast of no no no you need two plants and it's got to be to the
left of his tile you see the only one he can get to two plants to cash here right next
to yeah exactly oh [ __ ] he has a oh I didn't see this tile okay yeah that makes
sense and then heat bump them [Music] hmm it's very important to get that sequence
proper because if you don't do it properly then he can SP2 asteroids and suddenly you
can't get one TR anymore yep and now I'm screwed [Music] and now you convert your plants and you fund
terraformer yep you're right so here on top of the yes
yeah I like that I'm not sure if you can see my mouse when I do this uh no reason not to
take it now yep found it [Music] oh but now my point from earlier is still here I can
I can actually just take the last heat pump if he doesn't take it so he doesn't get it
at the start of next gen yeah exactly which is worse I mean either way he's probably not gonna now right? I think yeah we'll take it I would
take it huh probably Builder is the last one to be taken [Music] and pass very interesting game yeah I mean I I think I know you guys and
you keep surprising me keep Noctis City starting hand but don't play it until last generation
that's the best thing about Noctis City is early in the game yeah I hate this draft so
much real point but at the same time I thought Tempo was very important in these short games
so I don't know I guess I'm confused because what does noctis have to do with Tempo playing
that's all I mean I spend three gold for the patent in my opening hand it seems the card
has to be really good if I just pick up this card in my opening hand to play it in the
last generation especially when it's the tempo game that's just I mean I think it's like
basically always four to five points right Anthracite look at my draft what would you
pick can you play ecosystems no I lack a microbe tag does he have a microbe tag he doesn't
he doesn't have an animal either hmm so I'm actually leaning towards research
here because I cannot let him have it I think it's not unreasonable to take research
yeah yeah that's what I would do I think but uh yeah I think I'll take small animals yep
I am considering Advanced Alloys but I I think small animals is also better nonono Alloys
is dead let's look at our hands real quick yeah I mean It's Tricky it's unlikely that
ecosystems is playable for either of You because it's very hard to get a playable microbe tag
here um maybe just business contacts oh it's not too
too greedy to spend so many on just cards it's one of those two for sure really? it depends on what he finds I mean
10 is a lot to pay for cards at this juncture yep um you could gamble on ecosystems and keep it
yeah I'm having I have some card draw left in my hand it could be yeah it's close but I think I'd lean towards ecosystems
we can try yeah I think ecosystems is the pick for you because I'm closer to it than
you are and uh yeah yeah he already has fish so huh I'll take
Optimal and solar power is useless but optimal is it still worth it just for this I only
have one space event I want to play probably not um I mean I spent 10 I get six
pack so it's not terrible if I pick up one more it's worth it but I don't know yeah Anthracite
would you pick up research here or not you can yeah you have a lot of cash and yes yeah
this feels so committal if I only find dead cards this is yeah this
will be really hard to recover from I think you can take the first three since you have
Mars U yea all right so water is the last one to be terraformed
this game it looks like maybe most likely yeah those are some RIP's I don't think I'm in rush I can just draw
right no now I'd probably play Mars U and cycle power plant [Music] uh dead card I just draw again yeah play standard
tech or yeah draw yeah draw using restricted um let's look at our hand standard Tech draw
and then I'm probably looking at small animals herbivores something like this yea yeah now I like uh Small animals [Music] that's probably all we're getting
this gen here Anthracite would you take plants or fish
probably Fish I think it's pretty close between the two
it's pretty close both are pretty good what quite a nice sequence for you I just uh get an animal um I think I would uh oh I have I can actually
play Plantation if I want yea the challenge is you give up a Herbivore if you do that
but you do get the four cash back  I think since he doesn't have a conversion yea I have to convert at the start of next
gen either way yeah yeah so you can just play Plantation there yeah and then next gen I
can start Herbivores convert again Yeap now let's look at our hands I think pass probably um just flip through the Milestones again it's not obtainable yeah yeah that's Pass?
I think we pass all of the awards are surprisingly bad for
us but I guess yeah I think I like his his position quite a bit more yea standard City okay that was surprising yeah I was thinking here he might do that
it's a little bit annoying I think I think he's got you it looks like it so see you oh
my God there's some cheap points at this point I don't think Earth catapult I played it was
it earlier today where I was told it was probably a mistake because it's so late in the game
the same applies here right yeah I think CEO is just better card here yep okay Anthracite
look at the draft again I think this is a win-win for you right yeah
it is but I'm trying to consider considering I just SP'ed a city I still think this is the weakest probably
but I think you take Ecozone you get Mangrove
back right I'm not sure yeah does anyone have Habs (Protected
Habitat) no then I guess you have to take preds yeah I think so as well oh hello well uh I'm I'm feeling ecozone and
just pray to God I get a microbe at some point what do you think otherwise mangrove Mangrove is three points Ecozone is two I
think Mangrove is better for you to be honest but uh I don't think it matters though to
be honest I think you're I think a toast here yeah his first his first pick was preds too
but if I am toast maybe I should take Ecozone to try to get lucky yeah but yeah I mean that's this is lose/lose
it doesn't matter what you pick it's really bad for you I could just hit the concede button
I'll be back in a bit all right the question is also what's better for Ghaleon I think Mangrove is the better card of the
two I think it should be more points than ecozone in the
end unless you get lucky and find a microbe tag but uh you can get a microbe tag by with
Mangrove on two cards as well so I think I think you convinced me yeah it's very unlikely
I'll get the Microbe tag [Music] uh so I'm thinking I'm just gonna herbivore
and convert but I mean you already played virus so maybe I'm not in a rush not in a rush to do what I'm just thinking
out loud I think I'm gonna do herbivores and then convert yeah that's the play that's a misplay yeah you work towards Noctis
and you have it oh yeah yeah that's a good point I should have converted
here because then my next conversion can be next to Noctis I see what you're saying It's not the worst though yea I'll probably
get there anyway but yeah I see a small mistake no giant mistake you can still go across the
top of yeah I mean to be fair if I if I went here uh with my city (conversion) he would
put the ecozone next to a noctis yeah yeah exactly so I think it's fine I would have
played ecozone there if if I didn't know you had Noctis so yeah that's fair I like Mangrove
on cards now yeah that's the difference between me and
you guys I would have taken this spot like ages ago but I think if I'm understanding
you you probably want this now because we're desperate and we're behind am I right We got Viral Enhancers that's a nice card
oh I regret not keeping the uh Ecozone now but what can you do I think we should play
it though you think we should play it yeah unlocks ecosystems yeah but is this last gen
I guess I can draw first sure I'm not sure this is last gen yet so [Music] now I think you play viral grass and convert get rid of fields yeah yeah I think that this is like the death blow
for you yep let's convert above Noctis now
take your small animal uh he's not ending so I just pass I guess but yeah yeah maybe I had to 
risk Miner earlier I'm not sure seems like a good way to lose it feels like I'm losing anyway not sure yeah
but you cannot find Miner when I have Superior prod and you have exactly two uh no three
minerals over me yeah you're right it's it's like suicide I guess uh none of the awards
I could really fund none of it yeah no you cannot fund anything anything you fund is
just guaranteed loss yeah we can't fund anything greenhouses yeah yeah definitely well you got Dev Center just keep greenhouses I guess yeah I wonder Anthracite will you keep Corporate
here for landlord reasons no I don't think I would either oh I misplayed I misplayed pretty hard actually
what did you do I should have SP Greenery Greenery oh yeah instead of what I did show
your hand good point I think you play Noctis convert yea free water can you get this probably not unless he has cards Let's just draw see what we get Media Group technically playable with these
2 cards yea Earth Office I mean do I just start playing this or? yea Earth Office Media
Group Might aswell but I kind of don't want to play CEOs if I
get another gen I want to find what can I find birds or something this is pretty rough for me here you can still win this you still have a shot
at it what? How?! because I cannot end I cannot end yeah I think one more Generations you
lead by 18 points yeah it seems like an uphill battle because you also have predators and
stuff right and fish I don't know what he can do to come back no
I don't either I'm just passing here which is pretty sad
still oh I'm just no I can just pass as well to be honest this
I wanna I'd drop I'd drop Media Group never get anything better in case you find something
that you want to play to open yeah but there's no point in playing it now I might as well
wait yeah I think there is because if you want to open with an event you're always playing
Media Group and you might want to open with an event and then pass yeah [Music] Loan I guess yeah I'm getting I'm getting uh none of these tasty
animals I want I think it's uh I probably need to steal some sort of maybe
it's desperation at this point I'm honestly hesitating between two and four
here I think I will take two so many dead Cards yeah sure I mean yea I mean I could grief one Greenery from him
in some scenario but 17 it's the only plant hate I got but it's
very desperate I have uh I have a little I have optimal Aerobraking but um uh is it worth it or nah five cash for three
plants don't love it yeah [Music] I think I would go uh we got seven cards I'd draw and then if you
don't find anything I would go Large Convoy yeah I did not find anything I would play
Large Convoy probably on Steel of card there's also two
plants here no yeah you did pass him uh flooding which he took
so you might want to block the plants What did I pass him? flooding really is he
gonna play that? I mean he wants to end right so yeah fine take the animals you sure plants
of course of course animals are two points and uh plants are one max yeah yeah you're probably correct but I don't know it
feels like maybe some desperation Landlord or something no maybe plants into landlord
would have been I think as soon as you fund an award he just steals it and you can't win
the game He did have flooding holy hell but flooding gives him nothing that's basically
just to close the game which is exactly what I need I'm leading yeah I'm not saying it's
bad but it's just interesting flooding like literally gives you zero right now I mean
it just saves him a bunch of cash on SP ocean that's true all right there goes the Miner and Raid his Steel yeah
I thought about it but I have I just spend all my titanium so there's no way I I am honestly
no no this is wrong raid his steel all right and play investment loan is it because you remember he has a steel
card or why his steal I don't get it so I'm also looking at a standard City and
just greeneries and that's it I think you can take the small animal and play CEOs on herbivores yep and sell two caeds by the way the CEO was
a mistake wasn't it because he hasn't used Predators yet oh my bad I thought he already had but it doesn't matter
I mean I'm not sure yeah yeah you're right he hasn't I thought he had so it would have made sense for him no he
didn't but I assumed he did because he should have given he could have drawn (protected
habitats) yeah I should have so I just assumed he did just sell two cards so we make the
Grievous mistake of assuming that Ghaleon is a good player yeah I assuming I'm playing
well it's certainly a mistake right you should know better what are you saying should I sell
two cards yeah well just sell one and then sell one that way you show him that you took
two actions it's less clicks to actually sell two cards
but I guess it's just to show that I'm not slow playing Jesus Christ otherwise it's hard to see yes I see what
you're saying so many gentlemen's agreements but uh one
of one of the others in here said that in the last generation it's fair game to slow
play if it's I mean in this game it doesn't matter because I'm lost no matter what but
earlier today when I was in our equal points with the with mihal they were talking about
that it's okay to slow play because it was very crucial to who's gonna win the game a
new uh show the awards real quick doesn't look good for me um there's a way I do landlord I think yeah
I think I would fund I think I'd fund Landlord yeah fund landlord and stall one card I'm selling the natural Preserve sure I would have funded if you hadn't um what were you have funded scientists Banker
no I would have funded Banker I kept insulation for it arh okay that was a good call but I mean I mean obviously
we're lost no matter what but maybe could you really have stolen landlord if I funded
it while it was cheap like early in the game no I cannot steal Landlord that's your question
yeah yeah now you can't but could you have done it earlier if I had funded it while it
was cheaper than 20 it's the question uh uh yeah if you had funded it earlier I
would have done everything I could to steal it yeah which probably wouldn't have been
enough because uh I had no time in hand but uh and now I think you can SP City two North
of noctis and convert on the card yea SF Memorial why not um you can 23 23 I have SF Memorial yeah you
can play SF but do I have this and this and this and two standard greeneries should we
math it out or just play just look at uh what's that what's the countdown then look something uh I win landlord that's no question I think SF greenhouses Advanced ecosystem
no and one green oh you first first you want to do greenhouses ecosystems actually yeah because my point is I might not have
for two greeneries yes spend your heat first by the way Why? it's just there's a bug in
the game I don't know if they fixed it or not but they fixed it is fine now okay really
okay there used to be hmm um so I have 23 that I have 17 left no wait
that's not math so then I think we SP another city on two plants here and we can play SF
still so might as well play SF first so convert on the steel getting 2 cash back there's also this these two plants actually
no no we're gonna put a city there yeah come right there and then play SF uh City yeah first play SF
because you can afford it and you're always playing it and now SP that City yep yep yep and play Lightning Harvest yeah yeah that's pretty much it gg gg very
close and well quite close in the end pretty close actually I'm gonna end at 90 right uh
it depends on your Herbivore count yeah yeah you should have had 91 because we put their
we put the CEO on the wrong card yeah 91 and 94. Preds was what killed you the draft where
he got uh he got eco Zone and preds was yeah I'm ehh it's it's very easy for me to just
be uh be a smart in in hindsight but I think the play was to do ecozone right and just
Ecozone one was only one point in the end so it wasn't worth it for me no I think Mangrove
is fine it was just a bad draft for you where he got to he got two very good cards and yeah
Mangrove got you viral Enhancers so in hindsight it's completely correct to take Mangrove right
because if you don't play mangroves then you don't get viral and if you don't viral you
don't play Advanced Eco Mangrove is four points whereas ecosystems is like two points for
you um yeah so Mangrove is the right pick it's just that was just bad draft pack for
you because he got two good cards and preds preds was like five points here or something
well close game I thought we were completely out maybe earlier landlord somewhere no you
can't do landlord because then he just takes it anything you funds he just takes I'm just
looking for a way I could have won it I refused to believe that it was lost no matter what
I did you know what I mean I don't think it was lost no matter what all
you had to do was not get hit by preds without preds you might you find preds then he has to end and uhm
that was close oh what happened did I mess up something how
did he win by five I thought the game was telling me he was only ahead by a few points
no well my final conversion was three points as I put it between cities yeah 92 to 88 when
he passed okay yeah well GG GG boneless good game
