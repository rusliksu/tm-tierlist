Terraforming Mars is my favorite board game. It's 
by far the game I've spent the most hours playing   and I feel like I have a pretty deep understanding 
of the game at this point. So I decided to make   this sort of elaborate strategy guide for the 
game. Here's a list of what the 20 videos will   be containing. If you want to you can go to the 
end of this video to see all the tips I have for   you. In this video and also in the next one I'll 
give you tips to help you win without going into   too much detail and then I will elaborate on 
some of these points in future videos. At least   that was the idea but I find myself incapable of 
keeping things short and to the point so some of   these tips will be fairly long I like to talk 
you have been warned. I expect you to know the   rules of the game but beyond that these tips are 
helpful to beginners as well as high skill players   so grab a block of cheese from the fridge put on 
subtitles because the subtitled the whole thing   and let's get into it tip number one realize that 
Terraforming Mars is an Indian building game and   play accordingly Mega Credit First VP later this 
might be stating the obvious I think most players   are aware of this concept but Terraforming Mars is 
a really complex game and I do have a few things   to say on this topic in the beginning you need 
money income I'm using the term money income a   bit Loosely here but here's exactly what I 
mean here's an equation I made money income   is literally anything that gives you Mega Credit, 
steel or titanium so you can buy stuff during the   game Mega credit production is the best you can 
get steel and titanium production is good TR is   fine but somehow it's a little worse than Mega 
Credit production just because TR tend to be a   bit expensive in comparison but sometimes you 
won't have any Mega Credit production in your   opening hand and in that case TR is a good plan 
B actions and effects refer to cards you just   straight up give you Mega credits like it could 
be Martian rails or Meat Industries although these   two examples are usually better in the mid game to 
be honest and finally when I say discount on cards   it could be any of these but just to give you a 
frame of reference Earth Catapult has a discount   card value of two and the reason the squares is 
well I have autistic Tendencies and also it's just   to emphasize that the more you can stack these 
discount cards the better discount cards sort of   kind of Stack exponentially I think then you might 
be thinking what about cards where's card-draw in   this equation what are cards worth here's my 
opinion a random card is worth about three   Mega credit on average in a two-player game random 
cards are worth a little more and the reason for   this is the two player games tend to be longer 
in terms of generations which means that the   games are greedier which then mean that the card 
strategy is extra good I'll get back to that so   you could actually make the argument that a random 
card is worth 4 Mega credits in a two-player game   specifically and yet it is still not that simple 
the thing about cards is they're worth more if   you have a lot of money income I actually made 
a second equation to explain the relationship   between cards and money income so money incomes 
times cards per generation equal to your   efficiency number and if your efficiency number 
exceeds a thousand then you have a officially gone   GODMODE and you will surely win the game notice 
that I'm saying multiplied not plus basically   you need to have a balance of both card draw and 
money income to get the best value if you have   a ton of Mega credit production but you have no 
card draw then naturally a random card is worth   a lot more than three Mega credits and if you 
have a ton of cards but you're still stuck on   zero Mega credit production then a random card 
is worth a little less than three Mega credits   unless of course you have so terrible cards and 
you're desperately trying to draw some sort of   Mega credit production but you get the point if 
you can get card draw and money income this is   how you can go GODMODE I'll talk more about the 
card strategy and going GODMODE in episode 3. now   it's important to understand that a TR equals a 
VP plus a mega credit production I know it's not   a hundred percent the case because of stuff like 
the terraformer Milestone and the banker award   and bonuses and minor things like this but for 
all intents and purposes a TR equal to VP plus   a mega credit production the reason this is useful 
information is that this will help you to evaluate   cards so nuclear zone for instance now we know 
this is basically two Mega Credit production and   a placement bonus which is actually not complete 
awful for building your engine as a rule of thumb   a TR is worth 8 Mega credit throughout the game 
this holds true in the first generation and in   the last generation however I still couldn't quite 
make my peace with it completely because I feel a   TR is worth a little less at the beginning of the 
game like if you think about it if you're playing   helion where heat can be used as Mega credit and 
then you really want to buy something nice for   your heat rather than just transforming 8 heat 
into a temperature sometimes you're going to   do this and it's fine but it doesn't feel good 
preferably we want to spend your heat as money   on something better so this is my reasoning I 
actually also made a graph that encapsulated   exactly how I look at Terraforming Mars in terms 
of the engine building aspect of it and as you   can see I did end up putting a TR to 7 Mega Credit 
in the early game I will talk about this in more   detail in episode 7 but basically the orange 
line here that is almost straight is the TR   like we talked about it's sort of 8 throughout 
the game but I had to make it 7 in the beginning   of the game then the green line is Mega credit 
production and the blue line is VP so if you are   an experienced Terraforming Mars player I would 
argue that this is where we're at I know it's a   little bit extreme to say that a VP is only with 
one Mega Credit in the beginning of the game but   it's more like this is a mindset I think you 
should be having and to be fair it's only if   the game goes to 14 Generations that it's worth 
one but if you are a new player or maybe even for   the average player to be honest these values might 
be a little bit too low if you want to you could   just add one to all the TR and VP and then this 
might actually be correct for the new players so   instead of like a VP being worth one Mega Credit 
in the first generation than a VP would be worth   two Mega credits in the first generation and the 
reason you can adjust it in this way is because   new players are just naturally not as efficient 
in investing their Mega credits which makes sense   here is a much simpler representation much easier 
to remember these are probably the values to live   by so in the first generation a TR is 8 in the 
last generation a TR is 8 easy to remember and   then the only thing you really have to keep in 
mind is that VP is lower in the early game and   then at at the end of the game it jumps up to 
8 Mega credit and then Mega credit is worth 5   to begin with and this is I think this is 
a fair value for for the newer players to   be honest now in case you're wondering what 
I think like everything is worth an average   um there you go I'm not gonna spend time on it now 
because I have an entire episode dedicated to this   if you really want to you can pause the video 
but I'm gonna move on now all of these graphs   and equations here are sort of Overkill and you 
could argue completely unnecessary I will stop   now I promise the point I'm trying to make is 
actually pretty simple Money income in the early   game good money come in the late game bad VP in 
the early game good - no wait bad and VP in the   late game is of course good here's another way 
to explain it tip number two in the early game   focus on climbing out of the hole at the start of 
the game you're in a hole and your first priority   in every single game should be to climb out of 
this hole the hole is a metaphor that you're   poor is basically what I'm saying at the start 
of the game you only have a money income of 20   because you start with 20 TR this is nothing in 
the second generation if you buy all four cards   and that's 12 Mega credits then you only have 8 
Mega credit is that nothing you cannot play the   game if you have only 8 Mega credits so your first 
priority must be to climb out of the hole and you   do this by you guessed it money income especially 
Mega credit production if you're playing with the   colonies Luna is really good even if it is a 
standard project that costs 17 Mega credit if   you have building tags in your opening hand then 
a colony in Ceres is reasonable and so on if you   are playing a five player game specifically where 
the games are shorter and the scores are lower you   could also have VP and especially TR in the back 
of your head even as soon as the first generation   in five player games it's actually entirely 
reasonable to just build your engine with mostly   TR but even then you still play the mega credit 
production card you get in the early game so it   could make the argument that five player games 
are slightly different but as a general rule your   first priority should always be money income in 
the start of the game right now what I want you   to take away from this is this mindset of money 
first VP later so just instantly you know that   indentured workers and lunar exports where you 
choose the mega credit production are great cards   on your opening hand whereas cards as Aerobreaked 
ammonia asteroid and Interstellar Colony ship are   bad cards in your opening hand Aerobraked Ammonia 
Asteroid is just way too expensive and the Heat   and plant production is not really what you're 
looking for in the first generation at least   not for this price and Interstellar Colony ship 
gives you literally only VP so that's not good in   the early game either so you might be thinking 
why is indentured workers a good card it gives   you negative VP yeah yes but in the same spirit 
that I don't really care about positive VP in the   girly game I don't really care about negative 
VP either like if you think about it this card   basically gives you at least five Mega credits 
why 5? because the card itself got three but five   Mega credits with accumulated interest in 12th 
generation could easily be worth 5 Points maybe   even 10 parts so literally always keep indentious 
workers in your opening hand it's really good in   episode 8 I will rank the cards and I will tell 
you specifically which cards I would keep in my   opening hand and then I'll also talk about trap 
cards cards like these that look great but they're   really not that good in the first generation and 
so we got Phobos Spacehaven and house printing   they can be good in the mid to late game actually 
because they do have VP attached to them designed   microorganisms is okay if you need the science tag 
but preferably you want to play this after you get   some money income and then it it's kind of awkward 
that this has a maximum 14 degrees requirement I   mean just don't get baited into thinking that this 
card oh this is overpowered because why else would   it have a maximum requirement it's really not that 
overpowered these cards are more like a plan B if   you literally have no good cards in your opening 
hand so trap cards are cards in your starting hand   that look good but are really not that good 
which means that Aerobraked Ammonia asteroid   underground destinations are technically not trap 
cards because these cards never look good here is   a rule of thumb that can help you to spot these 
trap cards tip 2.5 engine building cards should   pay for themselves in 5 or fewer Generations if 
it's very early in the game I might actually be   okay if the card takes 6 generation to pay for 
itself but it really doesn't feel good sometimes   cards like let's say immigration shuttles are 
okay if you have literally nothing better to   build your engine with remember the card itself 
costs three so this card takes a little more than   six generations to pay for itself in this case the 
card also provides some VP but nevertheless it's   still on the slow side to be honest the later the 
game you get the faster engine building cards must   be able to pay for themselves so be really careful 
what you choose to do with your mega Credit in the   first few Generations this really does matter a 
lot and if you do not climb out of the hole then   the hole itself the hole right it will become a 
black hole and in the black hole you'll stay poor   for the entire game and your score is gonna suck 
and you're gonna lose horribly don't get black   hole people tip number three in the mid to late 
game you need to make the transition from engine   to VP grabbing this is equally as important as 
engine building is engine is only good for the   first half of the game in the second half of the 
game you need to get all the VP you can get I   think the sweet spot for when to get VP like crazy 
is maybe when there's four generations left of the   game however pure Victory Point cards should 
really be played in the very last generation   tip number four play to grab the free bonuses 
attached to the temperature oxygen and venuscale   I'll go into more detail in episode 6 timings but 
basically the important thing is that you contest   these three bonuses they are important so we got 
the temperature bonus on the oxygen scale we got   the water placement bonus and the heat production 
bonus on the temperature scale and then if you're   playing with Venus we also got the card bonus 
and the TR on the Venus scale a few different   things you can do to get the bonus first of all 
you can keep cards that help you to get the bonus   so we got Deimos Down for obvious reasons three 
temperatures in one action makes it easy to grab a   bonus then we got giant solar shade and I have to 
stress this card must be used to get the TR bonus   on the Venus scale you have to do this and then 
we've got the strip mine this cast can definitely   be used to grab the bonus on the oxygen scale 
notably it is the only thing in the game that   actually gives you two oxygen at once in one 
action but you can also play this card a lot   earlier because of its engine making capabilities 
so both are good and number two don't give your   opponents an easy way to claim the bonuses making 
a play that just leaves the parameter one or even   Two Steps From a bonus is something you really 
should avoid if possible number three plan your   actions carefully especially when you're getting 
close to a bonus number four if you are the first   player in the Next Generation you can actually 
use this generation to set yourself up to grab the   bonus at the start of the next Generations this is 
due to the fact that you'll have more actions in a   row if you end this generation and also start the 
upcoming generation so just like poker play order   actually does matter in this game tip number five 
prioritize Milestones sooner in short game 4 and   5 player games in Long games Milestones are less 
important in two and three play games once again   I will elaborate on this in episode 6 here are the 
Milestones on the original map it costs 8 it gives   you 5 victory points at the end of the game here 
the milestones for the Hellas and Elysium maps   and technically we are now also talking about 
the first award because that also cost 8. so   here are the awards from the base game although I 
would say that it is actually really dangerous to   start an award early on it's hard to predict who 
wins so if you are going to start the first award   you must have a really really good feeling that 
you're gonna win it but regarding milestones in   the early game you should always have milestones 
in mind and you should always try to get at least   one of them I think we can all agree in this 
but with that out of the way I think there's   still a little bit of wiggle room here regarding 
when to buy them so bear with me here basically   milestones and possibly maybe the first award 
should be bought when you are in the 9th to the   the last generation which means that Milestones 
are less important in two player games because   usually two play games a longer and the scores a 
lot higher so I would argue that you should wait   until generation 5 or maybe even later before your 
contest milestone in two player games in fact if   I do see my opponent just rushing to get all the 
milestones in a two-player game I'm actually fine   with it honestly you can have them because I know 
that this is 24 Mega credits he's not spending   on engine and I'm pretty confident that the 24 
megaforate that I then instead will be spending   on engine will amount to more than the 15 points 
he's getting in three player games fight for the   milestones in the first award in Generation 4 in 4 
player games fight for the Milestones of the first   award in generation 3. in 5 player games basically 
fight for them as soon as possible in 5 player   games it is actually a Race So I think this is a 
hot take I'm pretty sure a lot of you is going to   disagree with me on this one as I think a lot of 
people just feels that the Milestone is a race and   this should just be cleaned as soon as possible 
and I mean if you can't get a milestone early   and you still have money to get your engine up and 
running then it is of course entirely reasonable   it also depends on your average score I would say 
like if your average score is 50 victory points   then a milestone is very important because five 
victory points is a huge chunk of your score it's   gonna be 10 percent however if your average score 
is 165 points and this is probably only usually   your score in two player games to be honest but if 
your score is like this High then the five victory   points for the Milestone is only three percent 
of your score on a side note if you do get scores   this High you probably know how to turn 8 Mega 
Credit in the early game into five Victory Point   by the end tip number 5.5 do not make too many 
bad plays just so you can get a milestone instead   rather go for the Milestones that naturally fits 
your game like if you're playing tharsis naturally   you go for the Mayor Milestone and so on if you 
have to make like one sub-optimal play to get a   milestone then maybe it's okay but just to give 
you an example if you start the game playing the   early settlement Prelude and then you play Phobos 
Spacehaven then you're like hmm I I only need one   more City to get the Mayor Milestone and then 
you do a build a city standard project for 25   and then you get the mayor Milestone or something 
dumb like this then you are in fact going to lose   like because what have you just done you've 
just spent a Prelude and 61 Mega credit just   to get a total of eight victory points and 1 Mega 
Credit production a titanium production a plant   production and granted you are getting a little 
bit of production but this is nowhere near worth   it it's not efficient tip number six don't buy 
the Milestones until an opponent is three actions   from buying the same Milestone or three actions 
away from claiming the last available Milestone   slot or technically you know if two players are 
close to getting the last two Milestone slots   also this but the point is that it is technically 
correct to wait for as long as possible before you   claim the Milestone even if you have fulfilled 
the requirement the reason is that Mega credit   is worth more early compared to later on so if 
you can't get away with waiting you should wait   sometimes it happens that your opponent just gives 
up because he sees that you fulfilled requirements   so then he's going to focus on other things and 
then maybe you just get away with just waiting   like four generations before you actually buy 
it and that feels really good so this is what I   recommend unless of course you don't want to keep 
track of when your opponents are exactly three   actions away from buying a milestone in that case 
you can just claim them all them sooner and you   know what this is actually completely legitimate 
there is so much stuff going on in terraforming   mars so if you just want to claim it go and claim 
it but technically it is more correct to actually   wait for as long as possible and obviously the 
reason that it's exactly when your opponents   is three actions away that that is because you 
only have two actions on your turn if you only   have two actions you can't get the Milestone when 
it's three actions away tip number seven plan out   your generation do the math okay so let's get this 
one out of the way in board games in general you   will do better if you do the math in your head 
and you plan your turns and so on unfortunately   this is especially true for terraforming mars 
there's no denying that this is a mathy game in   some people's mind this is the biggest weakness 
of the game not me of course I freaking love math   but I can appreciate that some people do not 
enjoy crunching the numbers all the time you   don't really have to do the math but if you want 
to here's the most important things to math out   in my opinion this is the math that I do in my 
head every single generation usually even before   the research phase before you get to buy four 
cards even before this I usually plan out which   cards and other stuff I plan to do in the upcoming 
generation then if one of the four available cards   present me with a better plan then of course I 
just change my plan but usually if you have a very   expensive card on your hand this can be useful so 
if let's say you have Earth elevator then I might   even start the math in the generation before 
because Earth elevator is so goddamn expensive   so sometimes you just have to pass the generation 
with a decent amount of Mega credit and titanium   so you can play some of these expensive cards in 
the Next Generation could also be the giant solar   shade and like we mentioned please use this card 
to get the one TR bonus and the Venus scale it   could also be IO mining Industries this is like 
the Jovian amplifier you want to play sort of   early on because it gives a good amount of engine 
so the math itself is pretty simple actually if   you do the math on the generation before it is 
simply your current amount of Mega credit plus   the mega credit production plus whatever else 
you can generate Mega credit somehow minus the   stuff you plan on spending Mega credit on in the 
upcoming generation cards or colonies whatever it   might be and then of course you also take into 
account steel and titanium steel and titanium   are implied in this case the number you're left 
with should be above zero or more precisely it   should actually be like 9 or 12. the reason I 
like doing it this way is because then I know   exactly how many cards I can afford to buy in the 
research phase does it make sense like if the math   adds up to six or nine then I'm know that I should 
restrain myself to only buying two or three cards   so this is just the math that I do in my head 
I think a lot of people do this actually other   examples of math I do is for example when I play a 
card I calculate how many generations it will take   for the car to pay for itself and then to take 
into account how far in the game we actually are   like I mentioned engine build a car should pay for 
themselves in five generations or fewer but the   later in the game we get in terms of generations 
the faster a card must be able to pay for itself   then in the late game I simply calculate which of 
my available plays Will generate the most amount   of VP like does this card here give you enough 
VP for your buck or does it give more VP if you   simply start spamming cities and greeneries we 
are now bleeding over to the realm of completely   obvious I'm gonna move on now so do you need to do 
all of this math when you play terraforming Mars   NO plenty of people actually do quite well just 
based on intuition alone and on a subconscious   level they probably still consider these things 
does it help to do all of this math YES yes it   does tip number eight aim for the greedy long 
game or a short TR heavy game first of all let's   look at how long a typical game of terraforming 
Mars usually is gonna be in a two-player game the   games will last for like 11 to 14 Generations 
mostly at least a vast majority of games will   if you ever see a game go to 15th generation it's 
because both players are just Omega greedy having   fun with a super huge engines and both players 
collectively just refuse to close the game I've   only tried this once and I can actually show you 
that like the only reason I let this game go to   15 Generations is because I just wanted to see how 
much heat and playing production I could get just   for the memes really five player games will last 
like 7 to 10 Generations mostly it is a bit harder   to predict because in five player games it really 
comes down to how much the players are around the   table really wants to terraform I've seen a five 
player game go to 12 generations and I've seen   a five player game being closed out already in 
Generation 6 and on a side note this sucks man   having the game close out so fast is just no fun 
at all this is why personally I prefer two or   three player games it's much more engine much more 
greed much more card-draw much more fun so think   about the overall strategy the overall game plan 
aim for the greedy long game or aim for the short   game where you just get a bunch of TR and punish 
your enemies for making this big engine this is   the nice push and pull aspect of Terraforming Mars 
basically there are four different ways that every   single Terraforming Mars game can shape out so 
number one you got the greedy engine and you want   the game to drag out basically you have the big 
engine you have a lot of money income and a lot of   card draw so it is in your best interest that the 
game drag on for as long as possible so this is   full greed it's my favorite if you have full greed 
mode you should identify the last parameter to   close and just never terraform that unless there's 
a bonus then then it's a maybe number two your   opponent has the greedy engine so in this case it 
is in your best interest to just close the game as   soon as possible like let's say your opponent 
has the bigger engine here's more card draw   then often you want to close the game sooner 
rather than later the greedy player will always   make the most points in the last generation and 
then if you allow the game to drag out for even   more Generations then he's gonna crush you now 
let me be clear this strategy of closing the game   really early it is severely boring and you will be 
hated and you should be hated for closing the game   this fast however this might just be the strategy 
you have to use if you want to beat an opponent   who has a lot more engine and cards than you have 
so this is how you actually counter the greedy   players you won't always be successful sometimes 
the greedy guy still wins but it is often your   best bet to just end the game as soon as possible 
alternatively we can look at number three where   you actually try to outgreed your greedy opponent 
either you have a big engine yourself and you   will try to to out-greed your greedy opponent 
and compete with him in the ultra late game it   could also be the case that you had a bad start 
and you see that your opponents is going for the   long game and then you just try to do the same and 
see if you can get some nice comeback cards Like   Satellites and stuff and then you just still try 
to win the Uber late game greed war and finally   number four all players try to close the game as 
soon as possible and everyone races just to get   the most TR as soon as possible and this one never 
happens I've never seen a game where this actually   well probably also because I'm in all the games 
that I've seen but in my opinion it never happens   there's there's no way everyone around the table 
is this freaking boring the point is you want to   identify how long the game is going to last in 
terms of generations and then you want to plan   accordingly you also want to look at who's got the 
bigger engine like as a rule of thumb if you've   got the bigger engine mod incoming cards you want 
a long game if your opponent's got the bigger   engine money incoming cards you want to close the 
game so determining how long the game is going to   be in terms of generation it's actually really 
useful so how can we determine this first of all   and I'm serious about this I want you to count the 
number of players in the game you might think that   this is not important but in terraforming Mars 
it makes a huge difference how many players are   actually in the game now the reason that the 
number of players matter so much is that the   game will end when the three parameters are 
satisfied like the water the oxygen and the   temperature the number of required steps to close 
the game stay the same regardless of player number   which means that if you're in a five player game 
where everyone is like eager to terraform to get   them juicy TR then the game is gonna be just over 
a lot sooner in terms of generations secondly you   want to look at your opponents what are they doing 
in the first few Generations so in Generation 3   let's say you have to look at your opponent's 
heat and plant production when you see their   corporations and their plant production the heat 
production you can actually get a pretty good feel   for what they are going to do this game are they 
going for the long game are they just wanting to   terraform as crazy as possible to be precise you 
should look at the parameter that is getting the   least terraformed and then you can try to get a 
feel for how long the game is going to be based   on that but just be mindful that when the water 
is about to close the naturally people getting   a lot of plants and when the temperature is 
about to close then people get a free water   and then they can also play the late game plant 
cards it's not always as easy to predict but you   still get a pretty good feeling for it here's 
a tip like if you see someone playing Soletta   early or ghg producing bacteria a Regolith 
Eaters then chances are the game is probably   not going to be super long some corporations also 
gives an indication of how fast people are going   to close the game if they play Unmi or Ecoline or 
Recyclon well then probably the game is not gonna   be lasting that long because then it's a pretty 
good indication that your opponent really wants   to terraform this game if you are in a four or 
five player game you have to make the transition   from money engine to VP grabbing a lot sooner if 
you spend the entire game just making engine and   you don't make a transition from greedy engine 
to VP grabbing in time and then the game just   ends a lot sooner than you would have liked 
then that means that you are going to lose so   like we mentioned this is why you want to think 
about VP and TR pretty early and like as a rule   you really should go for VP like when there's four 
generations left in the game but then if you're in   a five player game it could be pretty soon right 
if the game only lasts for seven generations and   so already two or three generations into the 
game you have to think about how am I actually   gonna get some VP with that being said engine is 
is still number one but just keep this in mind on   the other hand if you are in a two or three player 
game you can afford to be a lot greedier in fact   I think you should be a lot greedier here just to 
clarify greed in my opinion is having the biggest   money engine known to man and greed is playing a 
lot of cards which brings me too tip number 8.5 if   you are in a two or three player game you should 
always aim to play the greedy card strategy every   single game the greedy card strategy can also 
work in four to five player games but it just   it's it's a little more risky right because the 
game just might end a lot sooner than you would   have liked playing a ton of terraform Mass game 
I've just come to the realization that the greedy   card strategy is simply the best strategy in two 
to three player games so at the very least you   should always aim to play the strategy then if you 
have no luck getting engine or card draw and stuff   like this in the first to three generations then 
fine you can think about making a new plan but   this is really how I approach every single game in 
a two or three player game on the other hand in a   four or five player game sometimes I'll go for the 
greedy engine anyway but I might just go all in on   another strategy like cities or terraforming in 
a two or three player games the card strategy is   just Superior I think like when you think about 
it if you can get away with playing this greedy   card strategy then it's just a stepping stone to 
every other strategy in the game maybe except for   the terraforming strategy what I mean is in the 
games where I've been successful in going GODMODE   I quite naturally just picked up a ton of cities 
synergetic cards and Jovian amplifiers and so on   so the greedy card strategy and going GODMODE this 
is also how you can generate the biggest crazy   scores literally every time I've gotten 200 plus 
it is with this greedy card strategy when you go   GODMODE tip number nine get heat production in the 
early to mid game or actually maybe never never   is also fine in the first few generations heat and 
plant production have to be secondary money income   is more important in my opinion you should look 
at heat and plant production after you've gotten   at least plus 10 money income so like earlier we 
talked about the importance of money income in the   early game then you might be thinking what about 
plant what about heat isn't this also a way to   build your engine and while you technically might 
be right it's just uh it has to be secondary like   it takes eight heat a plant just to get one money 
income because of the one TR you're getting for   terraforming to put it simply plants are just not 
very efficient way of generating Gold this is why   this card designed microorganisms can be a trap 
sometimes plant and heat production is okay at   the start of the game if you already have like 
a decent chunk of money income going for you I   would say at least plus 10 or that would be 
30 if you if you counted starting 20 TR the   more the better of course but at the very least I 
think you should have 10 additional money income   at the start of the game it's really desperately 
needed once you have plus 10 money income then you   will get the official Boneless Green Tag Green 
Light and then you may buy stuff like design   microorganisms of course if you literally have 
no money income in your hand then getting plant   and heat production is fine like you have to play 
with the cards you've been dealt or do you what if   you're playing with colonies just to give you an 
example so in the first generation if I have the   choice between building a colony on Luna for 17 
Mega credits with a standard project or I could   play import of advanced ghg for 9 Mega credits 
plus three for the cast that's 12. I know that   Luna is then technically five more Mega credit 
but nevertheless I will choose Luna every single   time like it's not even close don't get me wrong 
heat and plant production is actually not that bad   it's actually not that hard to get 8 heat but at 
the same time it's just a very slow way to build   your engine so what is heat worth we looked at 
this briefly in tip number one but in the first   generation I'm willing to be generous and say that 
one heat production is worth five Mega credit and   and this might even be generous then we also run 
into the problem that you kinda also just want to   spend the first few Generations on money income 
so this makes it a little bit awkward but in the   first half of the game while the temperature 
parameter is fairly low then heat production   is worth maybe four Mega credits and then you also 
have to look at your opponent's heat production if   they have like a ton of heat production then your 
heat production is going to be worthless but then   at the same time maybe you are denying them a 
couple of TR so you know it's a trade-off if   you are the only one with heat production then it 
is worth maybe a little more so if you base it on   my estimated value which to be clear listening to 
me is a dubious proposition at best then the heat   production cards in general are a little bit 
underwhelming so heat production can be a trap   it's awkward that heat will only give a few TR and 
then the temperature is just maxed and then your   heat is completely useless compare that to plants 
plants are still good after the oxygen skill have   been maxed it gives you VP so remember the value 
of a card is three Mega Credits so for instance if   you buy Mohole Area then you are giving a little 
more than 5 Mega credit per heat production then   you also get a placement bonus so let's say it's 
a flat 5 Mega credit per heat production so it's   it's not great but I mean you still play this 
sometimes this goes into the if if I have no   good cards I might as well play this and I will 
say that the four heat production is actually a   good number it only takes two generations to 
get eight heat so this is actually reasonable   and then we got soletta pretty much the same story 
it's a little more than five Mega credit per heat   production but it is very expensive and seven is 
an awkward number so you would need like a little   more to bring it to 8 production per generation 
but man this is a lot of work I'm not a big fan   to be honest the only redeeming factor of Mohole 
Area and Soletta to be honest it is that you can   use steel and titanium when buying them then we 
have Micro Mills holy 6 Mega credits just for one   heat production yeah this is not a good card only 
buy this if you have exactly 7 heat production   you can like use this card to balance your heat 
production in a way so you always get to 8 or 16   or whatever it might be in that case it might be 
all right but I wouldn't probably never buy this   car if I get this car for free maybe I will play 
it but it's very I don't think I've ever actually   bought this card it's it's not worth buying I 
think so as you probably can hear my view on   heat production is not good it's pretty bleak 
I would say that some of my Terraforming Mars   friends actually hold heat in even lower regard 
than I do but fear not there is actually a place   for heat production in Terraforming Mars so when 
is heat production good if you played early well   you have to play it early but then at the same 
time you also want money income in the early   game so it it's a little bit awkward but it is of 
course better if you play it early number two you   are trying to close the game early in the previous 
chapter we talked about this can be a useful idea   in order to punish the guy with greedy engine so 
if you are the terraformer if you want the game to   close early then obviously heat production can 
be quite nice for this purpose number three if   you have a heat combo heat is okay if you have a 
combo so let's look at some of these combos first   of all we got the discount cards I am counting 
the discount cards as a combo in this case I put   in Optimal Aerobraking and Media Group because I 
find that these cards combined with some of the   heat production cards Works quite nicely together 
but really we could have just mentioned any of the   discount cards really I almost didn't include this 
because well discount cards are just making all   cards better right why is it significant for heat 
production cards I will say that I just feel that   a lot of these cards just fits the heat production 
cards especially the cheap ones and honestly just   with a little bit of help with a little bit of 
support a little bit of discount or something   then some of the cheap heat production cards are 
actually quite nice then we got melt works one of   the new promos sort of new 5 heat into three steel 
pretty nice everyone knows the Helion Corporation   and then we got Caretaker Contract and Insulation 
all of these cards just solve the biggest problem   of heat production which is that as soon as the 
temperature is maxed heat production is completely   worthless well if you have some of these cards in 
your hand maybe it's not so worthless anymore you   have some use for your heat in the late game then 
we got the thermalist award of course and it's   nice but just don't get baited into thinking that 
heat production is actually still good in the late   game just because you have the thermalist award 
it's it's not that important like we mentioned   five VP is not the biggest of deals and you 
probably have to spend like 14 Mega credit on   starting this and you also run into that someone 
else is taking this award from you it could be   that they just get a ton of energy production 
maybe they have some of the energy production   boosters and then maybe they'll take it from you 
anyway but that being said it is of course still   nice that this thermalist award exists it fits 
this nicely right and finally if you are playing   with turmoil then there is actually this really 
funny strategy where you just go all in and heat   production and then you pump delegates into the 
Kelvinist party because then your heat production   actually doubles as Mega credit production is it 
good? uh maybe I only played it like once or twice   but it was a lot of fun to be sure the point is 
that you have to have one of these combos then if   you have one of these combos then heat is actually 
not that terrible just don't spend the first two   generations playing Soletta and nothing else and 
expect to win the game someone once told me that   Soletta is probably the best card you can have 
in your opening hand and I have to wholeheartedly   but very respectfully disagree if you have mega 
credit production and you also can somehow play   Soletta and you can also somehow get plus one 
hit production additional heat from energy or   something so you have 8 and not seven then it 
can be okay but this is like a dream scenario   and this is even this is like not broken this is 
just it's okay it's fine because one free TR every   generation that is actually worth something that's 
actually quite good brace yourselves I did a math   so if you have exactly eight heat production then 
it is basically eight Mega credit production if   you think about it because remember one TR is 
worth eight Mega credits but then it has to be   exactly eight heat production and then we also 
run into the problem that when the temperature   is maxed so it's a little worse than this so 
maybe like seven Mega credit production and even   this number might be generous unless you have 
a heat combo so we are back to one of these if   you think about it it's actually not too bad you 
have a use for your heat in the late game so if   you have exactly 8 heat production then I would 
argue that it is worth 1 TR per generation which   is also exactly eight Mega credit production 
heat production by itself is underwhelming but   heat production With a Little Help combo or 
something then it's actually good it's still   not great but it's at least good so overall I 
probably still would prefer money income in the   early game but I suppose it also comes down to 
the point we discussed earlier that experienced   Terraforming Mars players are maybe just a little 
bit better at investing the mega credits whereas   there's very little skill cap to using heat 
now I know what you guys have been wondering   about for the last five minutes and yes this 
shirt in the corner of the screen is in fact   the same shirt that I'm wearing right now okay 
with this out of the way we can go to plant   production tip number 10 get plant production in 
the mid game or at the very least after you have   built a money engine now first of all let me just 
make it clear that I think that plant production   is a whole lot better than heat production you 
just have to play the right cards at the right   time a few of my Terraforming Mars friends would 
like never buy plant production like you you all   know this guy that guy that guy really hates 
plants like every group has that one guy who   would never in a million years play a plant 
production card even to save his life I think   that guy is kind of missing out plant production 
can actually be quite good so let's talk about   the plant amplifiers real quick if you play with 
colonies then my favorite one is Ecology Research   like if I get this card I might just seriously 
change my strategy I just focus on building all   of the colonies instead in one game I had this 
combo this was my opening end it was crazy it's   Ecology Research standard technology and then 
I had the Poseidon Corporation I kept very few   cards except for these cards like only a few cards 
that gave me gold production or something and then   I just bought all the colonies for 14 gold right 
and then after I've done that I just slammed down   Ecology Research and I just I basically crushed 
everyone that game here are the rest of the plant   amplifiers you might think wait what why is Viral 
Enhances here I think I kind of think this is a   plant amplifier in some games I have gotten quite 
a lot of plants from this card on average the   other plant amplifiers probably will give you 
more plants but then again Viral Enhancers is   cheap and it does give you a ton of other stuff 
as well now as it is the case with every single   amplifier in the entire game these cards are of 
course situational that that's just the nature of   amplifiers in this game like it's not every game 
you'll get three plant tags so you could play   nitrogen-rich asteroid and get the juicy 4 plant 
production but generally speaking I think all of   these cards are actually quite good definitely 
above average well maybe except for worms unlike the other cards here I rarely get good 
value from playing worms you need one more microbe   tag just to get one plant production and that case 
is still like a bit underwhelming if you get like   three microbe tags plus this one so you get two 
plant production that is actually quite okay then   it's a little above average but to not very often 
that I have three microbe tags and then I get to   play worms to get 2 plant production the rest 
of the cards here are top tier though mostly I   get pretty good value from these cards I think the 
sweet spot for when to get plant production is in   the mid game don't get it too early I don't think 
it's good I would even go so far as to say having   one or two playing production in the early game is 
actually bad in the early game don't get play in   production until it adds up to three or more plant 
production plants are just not good for building   your engine having three plant production in the 
early game is okay is like almost good having four   or more playing production then it's different 
that's okay 4 plant production is in the earlygame   that that's good enough because then it only takes 
you two generations to make a Greenery however it   is really hard to get 4 plant production maybe you 
have the dream plant opening it could be Ecoline   or something or it could also be ecology experts 
Prelude with farming or kelp farming and side note   naturally if you do get freaking ecology experts 
with kelp farming you just forget about everything   I just said and you just play this every single 
time the value on this combo is just so good so   however in most of the cases when you only have 
like one or two plant production in the beginning   then it's just not good it's trash it's compost 
it's not good here are three reasons why I think   it's not good to have one or two plant production 
in the earlygame one this is money you could have   spent on money income and playing production 
also tends to be quite expensive especially   in the early game it does become cheaper later on 
when the requirements gets fulfilled and so on and   number two if you only have one or two playing 
production in the early game then it will take   you like four generations before you even get one 
Greenery down and that one Greenery is only going   to generate you one money income and reason number 
three is this freaking guy like before you get   any Greeneries down your opponent's gonna throw 
meteors and viruses which just removes your plants   if you only have one or two plant production 
then chances are you will lose your plans at   some point during the four generations that take 
you to just get one Greenery down what you could   do is save some plant production in your hand in 
order to play them later but remember it can also   be quite risky to just keep stuff in your hand 
that you're not soon to use because the patents   alone cost three Mega credit but sometimes it's 
definitely worth it I actually tend to do this   a lot but you have to just be careful you're not 
tanking your economy by doing this plants are good   later on and they can actually be a great source 
of VP but that is basically what they are a way to   get victory points and VP is something you want to 
focus on in the mid to late game greeneries gives   you three VP if you place them next to a city so 
you get one for the greenery itself one TR for   the oxygen and then you get one for the city on 
top of that plant production usually comes with   some sort of green tag which can provide even 
more VP first of all the eagle eyed viewer will   notice that Viral Enhancers has found its way 
into this slide also but hold up Mr Boneless   didn't you just say that Viral Enhancer is a plant 
amplifier yea but on top of that Viral Enhancers   is also an absolute VP monster like this is the 
green tag equivalent of a Jovian amplifier and   it costs nine this card is very good so just like 
plant production I feel like the sweet spot for   playing all of these cards are in the mid game and 
even if you play them in the mid game these cards   can still generate an absolute ton of victory 
points well maybe except for Meat Industries   I will say though that even though Meat Industries 
doesn't give you victory points it is still one of   the best cards in the game if you're having a good 
game and you could get some nice Green Tag Synergy   up and running Meat Industries can just make you 
filthy rich same story with GMO contract but this   is turmoil card and let's be honest who the hell 
plays with turmoil even though the mid game is the   sweet spot for plant production cards then you 
still of course want to play these really good   late game plant cards the value on these cards 
are just insane which also go hand in hand with   the high requirements so even though you might 
not get so many plants out of these cards you   still play them the real reason these cards 
are also really good in the late game is you   guessed it they give victory points they all have 
victory points attached to them well yeah I guess   except for maybe greenhouses seriously though 
greenhouses is still a really good lategame or   you can play a little sooner to get the bonus on 
the oxygen scale also works the last point I want   to make today is regarding the last generation 
of the game in the last generation plants is a   wild card in the last generation plants are worth 
anything between 0 and 23 Mega credit it's worth   zero if the plant you're getting does not push you 
over the eight plant threshold and it's worth sort   of kind of 23 Mega credits if that one plant 
or plant production is just what you need to   make plus one Greenery in the extra round and 
yes usually people actually do buy the standard   Greenery in the last round for 23 Mega credits it 
happens pretty often actually so plant production   in the last generation is actually good it depends 
of course how much you need to get that plus one   Greenery in the extra round you want to time it 
in a way so you just get just enough to get that   plus one Greenery actually maybe you need a little 
more why because of this freaking guy we all know   this guy don't we the guy that literally is just 
sitting with cards like bird in his hand and then   he waits and waits and then he waits some more 
he wait until you pass the last generation and   then he absolutely griefing you by removing 
one or two playing production which is just   exactly what you needed to make a Greenery in an 
extra round it actually does matter a lot like we   discussed that Greenery could easily be worth two 
or three or maybe even four victory points I gotta   be honest I'm actually sometimes the this bird 
person I'm guilty in the next video we're going   to discuss the importance of slow playing in the 
last generation one of the reasons is of course   that you want to slow play in the last generation 
then you are less likely to be assaulted by this   bird person after it's too late to do anything 
about it if you haven't passed yet maybe you can   get a plant somewhere like a placement bonus or 
something I actually decided to cut this video   in two because I feel like 10 tips was maybe 
easier to digest than 20 tips and also because   my PowerPoint presentation kept crashing big PP
