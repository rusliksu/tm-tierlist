Hello welcome to my Terraforming Mars strategy 
guide video series for the sake of easiness   we're just going to continue from where we left 
the first video off so we're just gonna start   with tip number 11. Tip number 11 and 12 are 
about colonies so if you're not playing with   colonies proceed to tip number 13. tip number 11 
buy colonies especially Luna and Pluto the colony   cards are really good and probably at least in the 
early game the best standard project in the game   is the standard project build a colony for 17 Mega 
credits I will say that the once in a blue moon   pun intended all colonies are bad for you and you 
cannot use any of the resources for anything after   all they are drafted at random in that case maybe 
don't buy colonies but in 99 out of 100 games you   should at the very least have one Colony often the 
best colony is Luna but other colonies can be very   strong as well depending on the game Pluto Ceres 
Triton Callisto also up there but honestly all   of the colonies are really good it really depends 
on the situation like in the late game Miranda is   also really powerful you can make an argument 
for all of these colonies to be honest Pluto   is the go-to colony if you have money income 
going remember the relationship between money   and card-draw like we talked about in the first 
video money income multiplied with card-draw so   you need a balance in both in other words if you 
have very little money income it's hard to spend   17 Mega credits on just cards in this case Pluto 
is not as powerful you could actually make the   argument that if you're really desperate trying 
to get engine building caps you could just try   YOLO and just build a colony in Pluto and try to 
dig out some engine building cards this is fair   and although this YOLO-play does work sometimes 
generally speaking if you have little to no money   income then Pluto simply dwarves in comparison to 
some of the engine building colonies like Ceres   or Luna on the other hand if you have a bunch of 
money income then Pluto is excellent even better   than Luna in this case and speaking of Luna this 
colony is just always solid like we talked about   in the first video if you have the choice between 
buying a colony and Luna and playing a mediocre   card Luna just wins every single time let me try 
to explain it this way if Luna was a card Luna   effectively gives you sort of kind of four Mega 
credit production two for the placement bonus   and two for the colony bonus if people are flying 
there every single generation however in practice   it's a little lower than this because people are 
not actually visiting Luna every single generation   at least not in the early game as people are 
simply not set up to trade yet but as soon as   people do get the 3 energy production to trade 
with or something then Luna will pretty much get   visited every single generation almost maybe 80 
percent of the time so placing Luna between three   or four Mega credit production is pretty fair 
I think and this is not even taken into account   the amount of Mega credit you actually get when 
you trade here I'm only talking about the colony   bonus and the placement bonus so a colony standard 
project costs 17 Mega credits so imagine a card   that you pay three Mega credits to keep then the 
card costs 14 Mega credits and it gives you three   to four Mega credit production something like 
this would I buy this in the first generation   hell yeah this card is basically Luna Luna is 
very good let's compare that to some of the god   tier Mega credit production cards you could get 
in the early game so space hotels Luna exports   acquired companies all of these cars are better 
than Luna but to be fair these cards are excellent   in the first generation especially space hotels 
but this is kind of fair because space hotels   require you to have two Earth tags and that's why 
space hotels are so good and lunar exports is good   because it literally exporting from Luna so even 
though this card has absolutely nothing to do with   Luna just having Luna in the name makes this card 
good by association that's how good Luna is so if   Luna gets visited every single generation which 
means that Luna equals 4 Mega credit production   then Lu na honestly can almost compete with all 
these guard tier cards but even if we said Luna   to just three Mega credit production then buying 
a colony in Luna is nevertheless still a solid   play so if you have really good cards like these 
in your opening hand a colony and Luna might not   even be needed however I I think still if I have 
all of these incredible cards in my opening hand   I still would consider buying a colony on Luna I 
might just play all of these cards to begin with   and then and build a colony in Luna on generation 
2 or 3 worth noting people actually don't really   trade in the first few Generations usually it 
takes a few Generations as the trade income is   just so bad to begin with and also takes a few 
Generations before people get the three energy   production or something so they can actually trade 
so by following this logic it could actually make   sense that you just wait a little bit before 
buying Luna if you have better engine building   cards like these in your hand just be careful 
that the three available slots on Luna doesn't get   taken from you before you have a chance to get in 
on the action in the groups I've played with it's   actually pretty normal that the three available 
slots on Luna just get taken like immediately in   the first generation especially in four player 
games if being in a four player game and you're   the one guy who doesn't get a colony in Luna that 
sucks but let's say you're in a group where none   of your opponents actually favor Luna so nobody 
is building a colony Luna then Luna is not as   good because the trade income won't rise as high 
whi ch means that Luna might not get visited every   generation in this case we're back to Luna only 
being worth three Mega Credit production I will   say I've played Terraforming Mars and maybe 10 
different groups something like this and it's only   one of the groups where literally no one put any 
value on Luna except for me it was actually really   strange I had the only colony in Luna I had it all 
to myself so in this case Luna isn't as good but   even though Luna is less powerful if there's 
only one colony in Luna then it opens up the   possibility of getting a double Colony or maybe 
even triple colony on Luna via cards like research   Colony or space port colony in other words if 
you get a double Colony on Luna you are over the   moon and getting a triple colony in Luna is just 
out of this world almost never happens but when   it does it's really good you can even say that 
it's a play that eclipses all others All Things   Considered Luna is still really powerful and you 
should seriously consider building a colony in   Luna in the first generation every single game 
so the standard project build a colony for 17   Mega credit it's actually good it doesn't even 
have to be Luna it could be in one of the others   also reasonable and if you have Colony cards it's 
even better pretty much all of the cards this is   Colony somewhere and the text are usually good 
especially in the early game if you have several   of these cards and get just a little bit of colony 
Synergy then it can be actually incredibly good   just to give you an example here's the combo 
I showed you in the first video I also have a   whole episode dedicated to reviewing project cards 
tip number 11.5 a good solid play I often make is   to buy a colony as your first action and then you 
spend three energy to trade as your second action   in other words if you are considering trading 
on a colony then you should really consider   to also build a colony there before you trade 
and the reason you want to do this in the same   turn is though that you don't risk your opponent 
trading there instead of you or building a colony   there themselves as you've just telegraphed like a 
madman that you intended to trade here so build a   colony first and then trade immediately tip number 
11 if you're playing with colonies get three   energy production as soon as possible it's hard 
to explain but it is somehow just a lot cheaper   to spend three energy to trade than it is to spend 
three Titanium or nine Mega credit so glass half   full if you want to trade every single generation 
then a prelude card like power generation is just   worth like nine Mega credit production which is 
super good 9 Mega credit production is the same   as paying 9 Gold every single generation to trade 
so buy this Logic power generation is just the   best prelude in the game if you're playing with 
colonies honestly I have had games sometimes where   just straight up bought three energy production as 
standard projects because that's how much I value   having three energy production to trade with but 
this is a bit extreme of course to spend 33 Mega   credit like this so I wouldn't recommend doing 
this too often but if I intend to trade every   single generation then the 33 Mega credit I spend 
is sort of worth 9 Mega credit production so this   is not completely awful that being said preferably 
you do want cards that give you energy production   you can also visit Europa to get energy that's 
a bit cheaper it costs nine instead of 11 or   you can buy a colony on Callisto so tip number 
12.5 and this is a bit of a niche scenario but   if you have two space fleets but only two energy 
production then you can buy a colony in Callisto   to get your third energy-production and then 
you can trade here with the first spaceship   every generation and then you get a little bit 
of excess energy to boot which will be turned   into heat later and worth noting your opponents 
cannot really deny you this by flying to Callisto   themselves because when you already have a colony 
there then you get three energy so if they trade   there before you do then you're all of a sudden 
you'll have six energy to trade with with your   two space fleets instead of just one which is 
even better what your opponents could do is to   just build a colony and Callisto themselves so 
when you do this trick they will also get three   energy but it is what it is tip number 13 some 
things are better to do at the beginning of a   generation and some things are better to do at 
the end of a generation tip number 13 to 16 will   be discussed in a lot more detail in episode 
6 but here the shorter watered down headlines   which to be honest is probably all you need not 
gonna lie stuff to do as soon as possible in a   generation one Milestone and awards two getting 
the last few available TR if a parameter is about   to close three getting the best placement bonus on 
the map four claiming a bonus on one of the global   parameters in the first episode we talked about 
how this is really important to contest these   bonuses 5. spending your plants before you get 
hit by a comet like remember this guy yeah this   is why you want to start the generation spending 
your plans before these cards are just devastating   you six using Attack cards the cards with the 
red border this one is not a straightforward so   I'll try to explain it a little bit basically 
you should steal and decrease opponent's stuff   while they still have something to steal or 
decrease especially you want to burn their   plants before they have a chance to spend them if 
your opponent has like one energy production steal   it for the love of God before he has a chance 
to spend that one energy production there are   some exceptions here regarding reducing enemy 
production but I'll get back to that in a second   there's actually also this psychological counter 
argument here if you start the generation hurting   an opponent maybe that opponent is going to use 
his attack card on you as payback just something   to keep in mind some people enjoy retaliation 
freaking sadists and finally number seven play   effect cards giving you X based on opponents Y it 
could be like Pets or it could be Immigrant City   so this is stuff to do as soon as possible in a 
generation now let's look at stuff that's good   to do as late as possible in a generation one you 
want to play cards and use action cards where you   get X on opponents Y so this is not like the same 
as Pets and stuff like this like we just talked   about those were like effects now what I'm talking 
about here is stuff like Toll Station Galilean   Waystation Martian Rails Greenhouses Aerosport 
Tournament and so on I'm probably forgetting some   of these media archives is also a good one and 
as you go without saying that cards like Martian   rails aerosport tournament and Media archives the 
cards just gives you Mega Credit Now naturally   they shouldn't technically be your last action 
this would be like your second to last action   or something because technically the last action 
should then be to spend the mega credits you get   when you play these cards but toll station however 
should literally be your last action of the   generation it's like it physically hurts me when 
I see someone playing toll station at the start   of generation like why would you do that I'm too 
polite to say anything but I really cringe and I   facepalm and I'm hurting inside like you literally 
get additional potential value for free if you   wait for as long as possible before playing these 
cards like toll station so literally play toll   station or stuff like this at the very last action 
of the generation or at least until everyone else   has passed you know two making plays to set 
yourself up to win a race at the start of the   upcoming generation like the surprise factor is 
of course bigger if you wait until the very last   minute before you reveal your master plan this 
also works even better if you are the first player   in the upcoming generation three terraforming with 
heat resources and action cards it is technically   correct to wait for as long as possible before 
spending your heat resources because increasing   the temperature scale might just be helping your 
opponent and you want to wait for as long as   possible before potentially helping your opponents 
I can only think of three exceptions to this rule   A you can claim a bonus B the temperature 
parameter is closing and you really want to   get the last few available TR before it closes 
completely and C you yourself have a card with a   temperature requirement not quite being met and 
spending exactly your heat and increasing the   temperature is the last bit you need in order to 
play that card 4 decreasing an opponent's energy   production if they are using it for something 
specific like trading or powering action cards   so if you see an opponent who is using his energy 
production for something specific then you want   to decrease their energy production as late 
as possible to do the most damage preferably   after they've already passed the generation so 
the eagle-eyed viewer will have noticed that I   just told you to use attack-cards as soon as 
possible but here's the rule of thumb if they   have one energy production remove it immediately 
but if you play with colonies and they have three   energy production or if they are powering some 
sort of card and they have four energy production   something like this then you want to wait for 
as long as possible and while we add it you can   also make the argument that you should just wait 
for as long as possible before decreasing enemy   production in general simply because this will 
mess up their calculation a little bit but you   know this is minor things the most damage you can 
do is definitely decreasing the energy production   exactly when they have passed and they just 
oh I needed that energy production to trade or   something that's when you can do the most damage 
also a very niche scenario here but number five   if your opponent has predators and you have an 
animal card with no animals on it make the animal   as late as possible preferably after the Predator 
guy targets another player and eats their animal   instead of yours or if no one else has any animals 
maybe the correct play is to just never create an   animal if you have zero animals that is and then 
you can literally just watch the Predator starve   to death okay now we're talking about really 
specific examples but you get the point I'm   trying to make it really does matter which stuff 
you do at the start of a generation and it really   does matter which stuff you're doing at the end of 
a generation tip number 14 spend only one action   on your turn unless you have a reason to spend two 
actions reasons why it's generally better to only   take one action on your turn one your opponent 
shows your hand before you do after you see what   they are doing you might make a different play 
two it essentially gives you more action in a row   which you can use to do all kinds of things and 
three if you are starting the upcoming generation   then you'll have even more actions in a row so why 
is it better to have many actions in a row you can   surprise claim a milestone you can claim bonuses 
without being contested and most importantly   things are like under your control lots of 
scenarios will benefit you if your opponent shows   their hand before you do so when you're starting 
the upcoming generation you should use this to   your advantage and also you should be mindful of 
the player who is starting the upcoming generation   because maybe that guy also watched the Boneless 
strategy guide in YouTube so here's where it gets   a bit tricky because there are some exceptions 
to this one action per turn rule in general so   when is it better to actually spend two actions 
on your turn so number one the players around the   table are playing casually and you haven't maybe 
unspoken rule of taking two actions on your turn   to avoid slow playing this is sometimes the case 
depending on which group you play in and this is   completely Fair also if you're just playing a 
casual game on the Mars app on real life to be   honest I tend to take two actions on my turn quite 
often it is quite normal as long as you know that   it is technically correct to only take one action 
on your turn most of the time because in a lot of   situations it really can't make a difference that 
being said there are also situations where it's   correct to take two actions on your turn for 
example number two there could be some sort of   race going on Races could be milestones and awards 
the last few are available TR the parameters about   to close getting the best placement bonus on the 
map or maybe a bonus on the global parameter is   like only two actions away then of course you want 
to grab that number three setting yourself up to   an even better placement bonus on the map like if 
you place water and then as your second action you   place something next to the water in this case it 
also makes sense to take two actions on a turn and   four build a colony is your first action and trade 
as your second action we already talked about this   and number five playing around stuff like Energy 
Tapping and Power Supply Consortium so what you do   is as the first action you create your energy 
production and then as your second action you   spend the energy production immediately and number 
six is once again this freacking guy so number six   acquiring plants and then building a Greenery 
so this is how you play around asteroids so once   again you spend your first action getting the last 
plants you need and then as your second action you   make a Greenery and seven if possible consider 
spending your mega credit steel and titanium   immediately to play around like Sabotage Air 
Raiders Hired Raiders something like this but   this is like a little less important but sometimes 
it does come into play sometimes it's just nice to   just spend all your mega credit at once if like if 
this is the plan you have on this generation why   not just do it immediately so I know that this 
is a lot of information at once but here's the   point the point is you want to spend one action 
on your turn this should like be second nature   to you if you do spend two actions on your turn 
you must have a reason for doing so that being   said like we talked about and as long as you know 
that there's this technically the correct way to   do it then well you can still just play casually 
and take two actions on your turn it's fine it   really depends on how much you want to win and how 
the players around the table feel about this tip   number 14.5 in the last generation is it is extra 
important to only take one action on your turn   the reason why this is important is first of all 
well what if it's not really the last generation   perhaps your opponent is surprised closing the 
game or perhaps he is surprised not closing the   game which can be equally as devastating and two 
slow playing is crucial for fighting for awards   if for example the Miner award has been started 
it's really nice to know how much you need to win   the award and how much titanium you can actually 
afford to spend on Jovian amplifiers and stuff   like this number three if you pass the generation 
before your opponents then they might burn your   plans or decrease your plant production denying 
you that plus one Greenery from the extra round   like remember this guy the bird person this guy 
that just intentionally really waits until you   pass the last generation and then he just removes 
your plants or plant production preventing you   from getting the plus one Greenery it's really 
annoying if you are actually this bird person   yourself brings us to number four you should wait 
for as long as possible before removing opponent's   plant production especially in the last generation 
basically all of these annoying little mind games   they just work a lot better if you're the last 
one to pass the last generation so these are the   reasons why it's especially important to only take 
one action on your turn in the last generation in   other words you shall not pass the last generation 
before your opponent if possible are there   exceptions when it comes to the last generation as 
well yes here they are when is it better to spend   two actions on your turn in the last generation 
number one you're in a rush to start the last   award two you're in a rush to get the last bit of 
available TR before the game closes three you want   the good placement bonus or actually if it's one 
of those games where the map is just filling up   like crazy then maybe you just want a placement 
bonus like it sometimes happens that there are   only maybe one good city spot left or something 
like this in this case it's of course also a race   to get the last good placement bonus on the map 
tip number 15 card sequence do not play a card   until you need the card for something so before we 
talk about this I should just real quick cover my   bases we talked about this in the first video but 
naturally engine building cards should be played   in the early to mid game because like we talked 
about in the early game you need money income   and you should start grabbing VP when they're like 
four generations left and pure VP should be played   in the last generation Jovian amplifier should 
also usually be played in the last generation   except for IO mining Industries there are actually 
a few exceptions when it comes to Jovian amplifier   we will look at these in the next video but 
generally speaking this is the correct way   to go the reason why IO mining Industries is good 
to play early on is because it gives you a ton of   engine two titanium production and two Mega credit 
production very good for building engine so if you   want to you can actually do it like this I I do 
this to some extent but you can literally just   make a pile with late game cards and play them 
in the last few Generations it's very good to   divide your cards like this either have them in 
your hand on the table or something so you have   some idea of which cards you want to play Here 
and Now and which cards you really don't want to   play until the late game so here are some reasons 
why some cards are just better to be played later   on first of all Mega credit is worth more in the 
early game compared to the same amount of Mega   Credit in the late game and two perhaps you pick 
up some discount cards during the game in other   words why would you play Interstellar Colony ship 
in Generation 3 when you could have played it 4   Mega credit cheaper in the last generation because 
you picked up let's say Earth Catapult and space   station number three in addition to becoming 
cheaper some cards can actually also become   worth more if you played later in the next tip I 
will elaborate a lot more on this specific concept   number four you also don't want to show your hand 
until you have to like if you're playing draft   your opponents might pass you science tags and 
green tags because they don't know you have let's   say venusian animals if they know they have this 
card played then they might not give you Science   Tags right so getting back to the point here you 
do not want to play a card until you need it for   something you want to play colonizer training 
camp as late as possible but still within the   max 5 oxygen requirement so probably you want to 
to play this when the oxygen is around four or   five something like this don't play discount cards 
before you need the discount effect don't play   ecological Zone and decomposers until you plan on 
playing Green text do not play herbivores until   you plan on making some greeneries well okay this 
one is a bit different because you also decrease   enemy playing production so if you really want to 
be a sadist you can play it a little sooner which   I can get behind don't play venusian Animals 
before you plan on playing science tags or   benefit from having animals in some way could be 
like meat industry so it could be large Convoy   although I will say that in most situations large 
Convoy is actually also better to play in the   late game could also be Miranda or maybe you just 
need the science tag to play something nice like   anti-gravity technology for example so as a rule 
do not play a card until you have a clear reason   to actually play the card if the reason is purely 
Victory points then you should play the card in   the last generation instead of what you're doing 
tip number 16 some cards are potentially worth   more when played later on this can be a number 
of different things but the biggest examples   that comes to mind is like science tagss or green 
tags so Science Tags will increase in value if you   pick up like Mars University Olympus conference 
or venusian animals green tags will increase in   value if you pick up like viral enhancers meat 
Industry decomposers ecological Zone and so on   this is why I sometimes hold on to cards like 
research in the hope that I will during the   game pick up stuff like Olympus conference Mass 
university venusian animals so basically you do   have to make an assessment do you want to play 
research now or do you want to gamble in the hope   you could get extra value from playing it later on 
what I do is I probably hold on to it for as long   as possible until I run out of good plays to make 
if I'm running low on cards or if the cards in my   hand just very bad to play right now then I might 
consider to just play research now but holding   on to science cards in order to play them later 
can be really good and remember research has two   science tags naturally it depends what the science 
tag actually does for you like if you need to play   it now of course just play now green tags are 
another example of cards that just might increase   in value the longer you hold on to it this is 
why I considered it a deadly sin to play Advanced   ecosystems before the last generation so firstly 
this card has literally only VP on it and secondly   if you played earlier you might be missing out on 
some of the free VP you get from Green tags like   these cards here and to be honest this could be a 
lot of points we're ta lking about all of a sudden   Advanced ecosystems is just worth three plants and 
five victory points instead of only three victory   points other cards also gets better over time not 
because of their tags but because of what they   do when you play it so I'm talking about these 
cards here there are probably more of these that   I'm forgetting so you might be thinking well you 
should just always wait for as long as possible   before playing these cards and yeah usually 
that's correct but it's not always completely   correct because remember there's also this aspect 
of Mega credits being worth more in the early game   compared to the late game could be that you just 
desperately need the mega credits right now in   order to make a good play it could also be that 
you need the science tag from molecular printing   to play anti-gravity technology or I need the 
Earth tag from media archives to play cartel or   something like this could also be you need the 
plants from greenhouses to get the bonus on the   oxygen scale so in certain situations it's better 
to play this cards a little bit sooner but as a   rule you want to play these as late as possible 
unless you have a good reason there are many   examples to be honest like resource amplifiers or 
robotic Workforce could also get better over time   and then it gets a little bit tricky once again 
because production is something you really want   to get earlier on which leads me to tip number 
17 play to maximize amplifying cards like insects   cartel and satellites these cards are very very 
good like often people feel that the reason they   lost a game of terraforming Mars is because 
the other guy got plus one Milestone more than   me or they got one more Jovian amplifier than me 
something like this but I would make the argument   that often these resource amplifiers are even 
more impactful than Jovian amplifiers people just   don't think about it this way because they can't 
really picture how many VP playing satellites   actually ended up giving like we mentioned in 
the first video all of these amplifying cards are   by Nature situational however most of them are 
just so aggressively stated that they're just   good in most games and even in a few games they're 
just stupidly overpowered and they will literally   win you the game this is why I really have to pay 
attention to these cards in your games so if you   have some sort of amplifying card like insects 
or cartel or satellites then naturally you want   to play to maximize the effect meaning that if 
you play cartel of course you for the most part   want to play all the Earth tags before you play it 
within reason and when I say within reason just to   give you an example you probably don't want to 
play terraforming Ganymede just so you can get   plus one Mega credit production from satellites 
it's not always the case however because there's   also this element of this sooner you get it 
down the better because remember production   is better the earlier you get it so it's kind of a 
balancing act sometimes it's better to play cartel   with five Earth tags in generation 4 than it is 
to play cartel with seven Earth tag in generation   6. it really depends on a lot of things it 
depends on how long the game is gonna be it   depends if you had a nice alternative play to 
make instead of doing the five Earth Tag cartel   and if I had a card like insects in my hand I just 
keep a bunch of plant production tags in my hand   then I still focus on money income and stuff but 
then when the six oxygen requirement of insects   have been met then I'll just play all the plant 
tags and then I just slam down insects sometimes   you can of course also play the plant tags a bit 
sooner if you have some nice money income going   if you're thinking which of these cards are the 
strongest it's very hard to determine as all of   these cards are by Nature very situational 
that being said I'm still willing to say   that like Luna mining cartel Miranda Resort toll 
station satellites insects are S-tier cards with   a goat I admit Miranda Resort is a little bit 
expensive when it comes to building your engine   but nevertheless the card itself comes with 
a Jovian tag it's pretty cheap so worst case   scenario you just played in the late game and feel 
fine about it toll station and Galilean waystation   are better than more players are actually in the 
g ame but even in two player games you can get   quite nice value from these cards it's just more 
situational in two player games I also consider   awarding a goat to Luna metropolis and gyropolis 
but for the purpose of engine building they're   just very expensive so you really have to think 
twice before deciding to build your engine using   these cards that being said I have won a bunch of 
games on the back of a god-like gyropolis like in   the right circumstance this card is absolutely 
disgusting speaking of cards that can be very   expensive but can give you a ton of Mega credit 
production we also got interplanetary trade and   sulphur exports kind of the same story with these 
cards I almost didn't put sulphur exports on the   left with this sort of bad cards but not really 
but it just feels like it is a bit expensive for   what it gives you Zeppelins is also a good card 
if somebody is going for cities but what really   brings this card down for me is the five oxygen 
requirement I mean that is rough especially   considering that the mega credit production is 
better in the early game and in my experience   oxygen is actually the last parameter to move in 
the early game so this card can be a little bit   awkward and even if you yourself are going for 
cities you still kinda don't want to keep this   card in your opening hand because it just might 
take too long before you reach the five oxygen   requirement but the redeeming facts of this card 
is that it also has one Victory Point attached   to it so there is a point in the mid game 
where you play this card and you feel really   good about it and to be fair in certain games 
where you just top deck Zeppelins at just the   right time then this card could give you a lot of 
value worms we talked about in the first video I   don't like worms so even though the resource 
amplifiers generally are really good also   keep your eye out for cards that just straight up 
gives you Mega credit so we're back to these ha   so do not underestimate these cards if you do the 
math these cards just might give you just as much   or maybe even more than some of the mega credit 
production amplifiers it's just it doesn't look   as shiny right when you see oh cartel 5 Mega 
credit production ah I want this once again   these cards are of course also situational but 
generally speaking I just feel like this resource   amplifiers and also these cards generally speaking 
they're good I should also quickly mention robotic   Workforce like if you combo this card with for 
example medical lab or gyropolis like seriously   I've had games where my entire game plan was 
just to make the biggest Gyropolis the world   I've ever seen and then following that up with 
an equally big robotic Workforce tip number 18   play the Good cards taking into account the 
number of players in the game first of all it   goes without saying that you just want to play the 
best cards naturally terraforming mars is a pretty   well balanced game I think honestly but there's 
still some cards that are better and some cards   that are worse and recognizing the good cards from 
the bad cards is an acquired skill that comes from   Intuition or experience so you can just try 
to math your way out of it like I mentioned   in the first video just instinctively I know that 
indentured workers and lunar exports are Keepers   in my opening hand whereas Aerobraked ammonia 
asteroid and Interstellar Colony ship are not   Keepers I'll talk more about evaluating cards in 
general in episode 8 but right now what I really   want to talk about is the good cards and the bad 
cards considering how many players are in the game   I don't think a lot of players realizes this 
but some cards are simply better in two player   games whereas other cards are simply better in 
five player games and once again a lot of this   comes down to the fact that two-player games 
are longer in terms of generations where five   player games are shorter in terms of generations 
in two player games the following types of cards   are very good and you should consider playing 
these cards one Attack cards cards with a red   border these are just some examples and of course 
keep in mind that hackers are just generally also   better than the early game game because it comes 
with Mega credit production but basically almost   all of the Attack cards are just really effective 
in two-player games as you're damaging your one   opponent more than the cost you actually pay to 
play the card but then you might be thinking well   you're also hurting an opponent if you're playing 
a five player game but the difference is that in   a five player game you're only attacking 25 of 
your opponents whereas in a two-player game you're   hurting 100 of your opponents with Attack cards 
it's really just the one opponent but you get what   I mean on top of that if you use an attack card 
on an opponent in a five player game you also put   a Target on your back and that player will likely 
retaliate on you rather than spending their Attack   cards on another player in two player games Attack 
cards will always hit you like no matter what you   do you can't there's no one else Two Greedy 
cards also tend to be better in two player   games because two-player games are longer in terms 
of generations compared to a 5 player game which   means that you can get away with more greed so the 
best examples I can give you is like AI central   interplanetary trade or anti-gravity technology 
these are extremely greedy cards and they are   very good in two player games but the five player 
games maybe not so much I will say that if you   can get away with it and play them pretty fast 
these cards are of course also very good in five   player games just know that these cards come with 
a lot more risk in five player games AI Central is   straight up one of the best cards in the game in a 
two-player game but in a five player game it might   be too greedy because AI Central is expensive it 
costs 21 Mega credits 1 energy production and it   requires 3 science tags and before you look around 
suddenly to spend the first 6 generations creating   engine playing science tags and then playing AI 
Central and then the game is just over because   you're playing a trash five-player game and then 
you lose horribly because you haven't had time   to make the transition from greedy engine to 
point grabbing this is what I mean when I say   you should be careful of greedy cards in five 
player games but in two player games AI Central   is one of the best cards it's kind of the same 
story with interplanetary trade this card can   also be very strong but it kind of takes a few 
generations to play all the different tags in   order to make this card worth it and also the 
card itself is very expensive 27 Mega credit   so you could also walk into the same trap of 
just making engine for six generations then you   finally play interplanetary trade and then the 
game is over in seven generations anti-gravity   technology kind of the same thing it takes a while 
to set up the proper science tag Synergy other   examples of cards that are better in two player 
games are simply card-draw cards for exactly the   same reasons as we talked about card-draw cards 
are just super good in two-player games the thing   is the game that lasts for many generations like 
13 or 14 or something like this the best strategy   in these games are just the card strategy and as 
we've talked about usually the longer games in   terms of generations are two player games so these 
are the types of cards that are just very good in   two player games but let's talk about five player 
games the following types of cards are very good   in five player games and should be played most of 
the time one cards that gives you something based   on opponent's tags or your opponent's floaters 
or something like this I'm talking toll station   Quantum Communications Galilean Waystation Thasis 
Poseidon just to give you some examples it's not   in every game that these cards are just broken 
in five player games naturally you still have to   actually count your opponent's tags and so on once 
again these cards are situational I should point   out that just because you have four opponents it 
doesn't mean that you get four times the value   from toll station it's not quite like this because 
two players in a two player game usually have a   lot more cards played than the people in a five 
player game that being said there's no doubt on   my mind that statistically these cards are usually 
better in five player games like literally often   the best card on the game in five player games 
is toll station it's insane in five player games   it can be at least two cities synergetic cards 
to a lesser extent like in The Same Spirit you   could also argue that tharsis and City Synergy 
cards in general are slightly better than 5 play   games than two player games however this one is 
not as clear I think because in two player games   sometimes there are more cities than there would 
be in a 5 player game but once again statistically   I think these are still slightly better in 
five player games and three cards that gives   you terraform rating like seriously in five player 
games people just grab TR than toilet paper doing   a pandemic like it's crazy the thing is terraform 
rating gives you both Mega credits and VP and you   need both pretty quickly in the event that you'll 
be playing a short games with few new generations   terraform rating is also good in two player games 
but I kind of feel like they are extra important   in five player games so these are the types of 
cards that generally speaking are better in five   player games tip number 19 don't be afraid to use 
standard projects but use them wisely standard   projects are there to be used the way the game 
works is that cards are more efficient compared   to standard projects however you don't always have 
the right card you need for the situation most of   these standard projects are sort of weak so you 
kind of need to have a clear purpose in mind   when playing them the trick is to know exactly 
when standard projects are worth it so here is   the Boneless guide to using standard projects 
I mean at this point why the hell not first of   all it goes without saying that standard projects 
gets a lot better if you have standard technology   especially when you play it with the colonies 
expansion but let's assume you do not have this   card in that case when is it good to actually make 
standard projects sell patents you should sell bad   cards but only the second you need that one Mega 
credit to buy something and even if you are buying   a card for 3 Mega credit and then you regret 
it happens to the best of us there's no shame   in selling that card again from one Mega Credit 
it's better than just never using it right so   the reason you want to hold on to your cards until 
you actually need that one Mega credit is that the   dead card on your hand actually might end up being 
worthwhile perhaps you pick up a lot of discount   cards a green tag synergy or you just pick up a 
card that requires the tag of the card you intend   on selling or something like this it could also 
be that you simply need cards in your hand even   the dead cards just so you have something to 
cycle it could be Pluto Colony bonus it could   be Mars University or sponsored Academies power 
plant only thing I'll say about this standard   project is if you need it you need it it is quite 
expensive for 11 Mega credits but it is something   you buy in a lot of games if you have to also 
like we talked about earlier if you're playing   with colonies you desperately need three energy 
production but buying three power plants like   I said is a bit extreme more realistically you 
get maybe two energy production from preludes or   cards or something and in that case it's entirely 
reasonable to just buy the last energy production   you need so you can trade in fact this would be a 
good play and once again if you are playing with   colonies you can also get energy a little cheaper 
by trading on Europa then we got asteroid for 14   Mega credits and then we got the Venus standard 
project Air Scrapping (no not ass grabbing) for   15 Mega credits these two are very similar I think 
which is why I bundled them together both of them   sucks man like these should only be played if 
you have a really clear purpose in mind so like   we talked about a TR is roughly with eight Mega 
credits so buying asteroid is overpaying by 6 and   air scrapping is overpaying by seven I can think 
of only three scenarios where you actually buy   this trash so let's start with asteroid never buy 
this unless one you're close to a bonus if you can   grab the water placement bonus off of this then it 
is worth it the heat production bonus is sometimes   worth it if you're desperate I guess like I mean 
if I hit production in the early game is worth 5   Mega credits and a TR is worth eight that's only 
13 and the standard project costs 14 so like minus   one still it's it's not that good but sometimes 
you're desperate and there's also this aspect of   you don't want to give the bonus to your opponent 
and two you need to close the game in the previous   video in tip number eight we talked about the 
value of actually closing the game early to   punish the greedy player at the start of the game 
this standard project is just way too expensive   but maybe in the last generation maybe the last 
two generations if you need like three more steps   to close the game for fine I actually do this 
sometimes it might just be something you have   to do in order to win the game and three you have 
a card in your hand with a temperature requirement   it has to be a really good card to Warrant 
this terrible asteroid standard project like   farming or trees or fish or something maybe tundra 
farming but otherwise it is simply not worth it   air scrapping is pretty much the same it will have 
to be like the venusian animals or the terraform   rating bonus on the Venus scale before you even 
consider buying this trash maybe Ishtar mining I   don't know you get the point I should probably 
gathered by now I consider these two standard   projects the worst standard projects in the game 
then we got the aquifier if we do the math this   standard project is also a bit underwhelming 
it cost 18 gives a TR worth 8 and a placement   bonus worth let's be generous and say four so 
that's 12 so if you buy it for 18 then it's like   -6 in value so it's not good however even though 
the math is also bad on this one there are a   number of situations where I will actually buy a 
water first of all remember that there are only   nine Waters to be placed on mars and honestly 
a few of those Waters usually go already in   the first generation so this means that if 
you have a card with water requirement then   it can be okay to maybe like buy one of these 
or maybe two of these in order to satisfy the   requirement of the card but the aquifer standard 
project is really expensive so once again it will   have to be the really good card to Warrant 
such desperation pretty much has to be like   kelp farming or Penguins capital or Algae are also 
worth mentioning but it's almost not worth it and   number two could also be that you have some sort 
of water Synergy going on it could be like Neptune   or Arctic algae three or again you want to close 
the game and water is the last parameter to close   you can play the water to close the game four you 
can get like an epic water placement bonus what   I mean specifically is that if you pay the 18 
Mega credits and buy water as your first action   then as your second action you can do something 
nice next to the water you just place this is   the redeeming factor of water is that you have 
two actions so you can spend your first action   placing the water and your second action and 
placing something next to the water okay now we   get to the slightly better standard projects let's 
talk about greeneries and cities once again just   to get it out of the way if oxygen is the last 
parameter to close and you want to close the game   then naturally planting greeneries makes sense 
and also if the oxygen parameter is about to close   maybe you want the last few available TR on the 
oxygen scale or maybe you can get a temperature   bonus on the oxygen scale then maybe it's worth 
making Greenery to do this could also be that it   has some cards with high oxygen requirements 
could be birds or insects or Zeppelins so we   kind of already talked about this but here's 
where greeneries and cities are different five   you can make cities and greeneries in the mid to 
late game to get victory points in the late game   it's actually pretty cost effective to have 
a few cities and build greeners around them   like we mentioned in the previous video greeneries 
are like worth approximately three victory points   in the late game if you play them next to your 
cities if you place the next to two of your cities   greeneries could be with four victory points and 
so on and to be honest this is not bad for 23 Mega   credits in the late game not to mention that they 
also get the placement bonuses so truth be told   in the late game game your cards actually have 
to be pretty good to compete with this like we   mentioned in the previous video you really have to 
do the math and figure out is it better to play my   cards or as a player to just keep spamming 
cities and greeneries in the late game so   standard project cities and standard greeneries 
are not good for engine building but there is a   very nice way to get victory points this is why 
it's better to play these standard projects in   the last half of the game the exception of course 
is if you have a bunch of cities synergetic cards   then what you can do is just to place a bunch of 
cities early on and build your engine this way but   to be clear it has to be some of the really good 
City Synergetic cards to actually warrant this   strategy I'm talking pretty much like immigrant 
City Martian rails for tharsis like I think you   have to have one of these you probably also need 
a little bit extra it could be like pets Rover   construction standard technology or Zeppelins or 
something like this we'll talk more about the city   strategy in the next video but the point here is 
that standard cities and greeneries is stuff you   want to look at in the mid to late game because 
they are mainly a way to get victory points and   the only Only Exception here is if you have sick 
city synergetic cards then you can also build   your engine with cities then if we're playing 
with colonies the last standard projects is to   build a colony for 17 Mega credits we talked 
about it earlier in my opinion this very good   in the early game you just have to do the math to 
assess if it's better to actually just build the   colony for 17 or it's better to play one of the 
cards in your hand remember that the card itself   costs three Mega credits just for the patent so 
when you kind of want to compare it so the colony   costs 14 and not 17. so when you look at it this 
way often the best play is to just build a colony   on Ceres or luna or something and then when you 
get your engine up and running Pluto is also   really good tip number 20 don't keep cards in your 
opening hand that has a crazy requirement unless   so the last thing I want to mention today is for 
new players mostly and that is just be careful   don't keep cards on your hand that has some sort 
of crazy requirement like birds or trees or lake   Marineris or open City I would literally never 
keep these cars in my opening hand unless you   have like the ecology experts prelude and trees 
or something but you know almost never I will   keep these cards in my opening hand so kelp 
farming is like a card might consider keeping   it's almost sort of worth it because there are 
so few steps when it comes to water but in my   opening hand I probably still wouldn't keep this 
we could also take this step further and say that   you should never keep a card you're not planning 
to play this generation and while this is a good   tip for beginners it doesn't really reflect the 
whole truth the really good players actually do   keep a lot of late game cards in their hand it's 
just you have to know when to do it so there's   no really correct answer to this one this is a 
lot of gray area so all I can do is just share   my thoughts on this so I would put it like this in 
the early game only keep mid to late game cards if   one your economy is strong enough to pay the three 
Mega credit patent without tanking your engine if   you have a bad engine and then you start buying 
late game cards or keeping them in your hands   then they're like dead cards forever and then 
you might just be drowning yourself two of the   card benefits you a lot when you then finally do 
play it Jovian amplifiers is a good example just   know that the cards you're buying in the early 
game and not playing they are not actually worth   three Mega credits for the patent three Mega 
credits in the early game is worth more than   three Mega credits in the late game because in 
the early game you're like investing these three   Mega credits on everything cool and then in the 
late game it might be worth maybe more like 10   mega credits so if you feel like the card is 
worth more than the mega credits you stand to   lose by buying it so early then you should keep 
it and to be honest when I play Terraforming Mars   I actually do tend to keep a lot of cards that 
become powerful later I actually watched some of   my replays recently because I intend to do some 
commentary of replays where I played the online   Mass app just to give you some examples I had 
a 264 gameswhere I get insects and ecological   Zone all already in generation 2 but in this game 
I had really nice engine building cards also so I   felt like I could definitely get away with it I 
don't know how many victory points these cards   ended up giving me but it was a ton an absolute 
ton but then recently I had a 278 game in this   game I actually didn't buy any late game cards 
in the early game but I think that's more because   they didn't really present themselves to me so in 
this game the latest I bought like a mid to late   game card I think that would be decomposers 
but that was on generation eight so this is   definitely not the early game anymore I definitely 
would have also bought Victory Point generating   cars like ecological Zone if I had seen them it 
kinda illustrates my point that there's no real   clear answer to this one if you want to watch 
these games with my commentary this should be   on my channel already it should be episode 16 I 
think examples of lategame cards you might want   to keep early so we talked a little bit about this 
but first of all Jovian amplifiers I feel like a   lot of players just agree that these cards can 
generate an absolute bunch of victory points in   the late game which means that they are probably 
worth to keep a lot other times I don't always   keep these in the early game it also depends 
I think I would always keep IO mining industry   in the early game it's just too good to pass up 
gives you a lot of engine gives you a lot of VP in   the late game others examples of cards you might 
want to keep could also be these juicy science tag   cards like like anti-gravity technology AI Central 
Quantum extractor Mass converter once again this   would also depend on how many science tags I have 
in my hand and if my economy can handle potential   dead cards in my hand and stuff like this because 
keeping some of these cards I just mentioned is   essentially a gamble because I cannot know if 
I will actually get the last science tag I need   to actually play this it could also be some of 
the good plant production cards it could be like   ecology research nitrophilic moss and maybe if you 
have like let's say two plant tags in your hand or   something then I would seriously also consider 
keeping insects or nitrogen-rich asteroid others   examples of cards I might keep in the early game 
could be some of the Green Tag amplifiers maybe   not in my opening hand but still pretty early on I 
would seriously consider even these these are very   good so these are just examples of cards I might 
want to keep early on in my games there's really   no clear answer to this one it just comes down 
to intuition and comes down to can your economy   actually handle it also comes down to the fact 
that you shouldn't keep cards you can't play it   unless you have a very good reason to keep them or 
maybe you're just a reckless Gambler in that case   you're allowed bonus tip number one if you play 
Draft hate drafting is a thing be very careful   what you give to your opponents that's basically 
what hate drafting means it is of course better   to focus on the cards that will help you the most 
but if none of the available cards are important   then you can choose the Jovian tag just that the 
other guy doesn't get the Jovian tag or you can   keep immigrant City just to the city guy doesn't 
get immigrant City and so on bonus tip 1.5 Synergy   play all the cards that synergizes with each other 
you should always look for Synergy when playing   terraforming Mars or in real life I guess bonus 
tip 1.5 a watch episode 4 on my Terraforming Mars   video series where I talk about Synergy bonus 
tip 1.7 focus on playing the strong cards and   for the the most part ignore the bad cards bonus 
tip 1.9 point Pi Point Apple watch episode 8 of   my video series where I read most of the cards 
from S-Tier to trash-tier in other words feel   free to check out these other videos if you feel 
like it I can't Promise all of them are available   on my channel yet but sooner or later I think all 
of these will be in my channel there's a link to   the playlist in the description as you probably 
guessed by now this video series will probably   take longer to watch than actually sitting down 
and playing probably maybe in several games of   terraforming Mars yourself which is a long time so 
if you want to see some gameplay instead you can   check out video 16 to 19 where I do commented 
playthroughs to be honest I don't really care   about high scores and Terraforming Mars I don't 
think anybody really does but that being said the   278 game is probably the highest scoring game you 
will ever see on YouTube especially considering   this is like the online app where it only comes 
with vanilla and Prelude generally you can achieve   higher scores if you get more expansions like 
if you play with colonies and preludes three   300 is definitely within reach if you have any 
other tips then the tips are mentioned here or   if you agree or disagree with anything feel free 
to mention in the comments I'm game discussing   all of this with you also if you know of any 
other Terraforming Mars strategy guides then   feel free to also write that in the comments then 
I will add it to the description like if you want   to I'm serious you can just shamelessly promote 
your own Terraforming Mars content I really don't   mind I welcome the idea of this being the place 
from which you can find all the Terraforming Mars   guides and so on I purposely didn't watch or read 
any other Terraforming Mars guides before making   my own because I thought it would be more fun to 
share my own view of the game rather than just   repeating what other wise men have said but now 
that I have made this guide I'll happily watch   some of the other stuff you sent me probably 
I missed something and then in the very likely   event that I actually learned something new I 
would talk about it in episode 10 called feedback   because this is a video I haven't made yet thank 
you so much to Fryxelius and the Stronghold Games   for making my favorite board game this game came 
out in 2016 team I think it says a lot about this   board game that so many players are still playing 
it like years later and it also says a lot about   the game that a guy like me just spent three 
months of his life making this strategy guide like   nobody really asked for I think you speak to how 
good the game is of maybe I'm just a weird person
