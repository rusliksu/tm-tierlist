Hello welcome back to my Terraforming Mars 
Strategy Guide today we're gonna look at   episode 3 part 2 strategies and today we're 
gonna talk about the Jovian strategy and the   Green Tag strategy okay so now let's talk about 
Jovian tags the rest of the strategies here are   pretty much extensions of the card strategy if 
that makes sense but for good measure I'll just   go through them quickly (lol joke) Jovian tags is 
it really strategy I mean if you don't get Jovian   amplifiers can it really be considered a strategy 
to be fair this is more like Synergy but you know   a lot of people like Jovians let's talk about 
them if you want to see game example on the mass   app where I go for Jovian tags and I'm Saturn 
systems then you can check out episode 19. so   Jovian Tags is a strategy that can work in both 
short and long games but I think I tend to favor   long games a little bit more because then you have 
more time to get the jovians jovians are great in   Greedy two-player games for instance because it's 
a part of the card strategy naturally if you play   a million cards then you're bound to find a lot 
of jovians it can also work in five play games   but it's a bit more risky the thing about the 
Jovian cards they're really expensive so they   kind of invite you to have a big engine a lot 
of titanium production and sometimes in five   player game the game is just over by Generation 
7 and you really don't even have time to play   your amplifiers because they're just so expensive 
in these short games Saturn system is a perfect   cooperation if you want to go for jovians because 
every time a Jovian Tag is played you get one Mega   credit production and also you get a titanium 
production which is nice for playing these   expensive Jovian Tags and the funny thing Saturn 
system is actually I think slightly better in five   player games but it's good regardless of player 
number but the reason it's better in five player   games maybe is that then you have four opponents 
who might also play some Jovians sometimes so you   get a lot of free stuff but you can also make an 
argument that is good in two or three player games   because when the games are longer and more greedy 
then people are more likely to play jovians Let's   talk about Jovian amplifiers there are four Jovian 
amplifiers in the vanilla game and funnily enough   they're not actually adding more amplifiers in 
the expansions so you only have these four and   yes I am counting terraforming Ganymede as an 
amplifier I mean if you play this card as your   last Jovian tag then it literally is an amplifier 
I think Jovian amplifiers are pretty well known a   lot of people favor these and this is like the 
set collection of this game it could be really   strong like sometimes you get 60 points and 
jovians alone or something and that's a lot   of points so it's really worth noting however 
it's not always these cards are good I think   people just oh it's a German amplifier I have to 
keep it I also made this mistake with the starting   hand where I started with IO mining Industries 
like oh it's an amplifier I have to keep this   I shouldn't have so sometimes it's a little bit 
of a bait so basically it's a little bit out of   your control like you can decide to start the 
game alright I'm gonna go for Jovian tags today   but then ultimately it comes down to whether or 
not you pick up any amplifiers because without   amplifiers you're not getting so much out of your 
jovians in fact all the Jovian cards are pretty   expensive the Jovian Tag itself costs something 
on these cards so this means that if you're not   getting a Jovian amplifier then usually the jovian 
cards are actually pretty bad so how many VP does   an amplifier actually give you it's really hard to 
answer this because sometimes it's like one point   or sometimes it's like 12 points so if you're 
having a good game and this is like maybe even   generous but if you're having a good game I think 
a Jovian amplifier on average could give you like   six VP and if you get this that's totally fine and 
if you manage in your game to get this many Jovian   tags then it's perfect then it's really good 
actually so how many jovians would you have to   have for this to be worth it so let's do the math 
here (Boneless attempting to do math in Danish) so   if we say that in the late game a victory point is 
worth 8 Mega credit and the cast costs three for   example IO mining Industries this is like the most 
expensive of them and that's because it comes with   a little engine but if you get six jovians this is 
worth it because then it adds up to 48 and that's   more than the 44 the card costs but if you only 
get 5 Jovians and you play IO mining Industries   in the last generation it's actually not that 
good it's a little bit lower than the average   but then again if you play IO mining Industries 
sooner in the game it's of course back to being   really good because then you also get the engine 
building capabilities of these cards then we got   Ganymede Colony if we set a victory point to be 
eight in the last generation well then you only   need three Jovian to actually make this card work 
and you need four Jovian tags to make water import   from Europa worth it and terraforming Ganymede 
you kind of need five Jovian tags to make this   work if you are playing Saturn systems of course 
jovians are better because then you get one Mega   credit production every time a jovian tag is put 
into play and then you might be inclined to play   your amplifiers a little bit sooner but even with 
the plus one Mega credit production I still think   you should consider waiting before playing the 
amplifiers usually you play these amplifiers   in the last generation except for IO mining 
industries so usually you have better things   to spend your mega credit on than just playing 
an amplifier early just for the plus one Mega   Credit it's not that good Jovian amplifier should 
be played in the last generation except of course   for IO mining Industries also there are a few 
other exceptions we'll talk about those so IO   mining Industries is actually kind of cool because 
this card can be played in any phase of the game   depending on the situation in the early game you 
can play this card as soon as possible because   it gives you a lot of money income like two 
titanium production two Mega credit production   I mean really what you should do you should play 
it as soon as it makes sense for you maybe in the   early game you had better engine building options 
available to you in that case you would wait but   mostly you want to play this as soon as possible 
if that makes sense sometimes it could even be   worth it to just pass an entire generation just 
so you can play IO mining Industries in the Next   Generation so really it comes down to do you have 
any better engine building options available to   you if yes then you wait before you play IO mining 
Industries and I'm talking about the early to mid   game of course because in the mid to late game 
you really want to favor IO mining Industries over   like Mega credit production in general because 
then you're also more focused on getting VP and   IO mining Industries like we talked about it 
can give you a lot of VP but like we mentioned   you kind of need a few Jovian tags for this card 
to be worth it at least from a VP point of view   in the late game if you play this in the last 
generation of course you're only playing this   card to get all the VP but then like we talked 
about just to play this card only for the VP   that is really expensive so you need to have at 
least six job in tags for this to actually be   worth it but it's not even like this this is 
just the average values really what it comes   down to what are your available plays in the last 
generation if your best play is to play IO mining   Industries go for it if there's another player 
that will give you even more victory points do   that like maybe you could take the landlord from 
somebody or something that's even more impactful   than IO mining Industries you just have to do the 
math in the last generation that's all I'm saying   then we got ganymede colony in 9 out of 10 games 
this should be played in the late game preferably   in the very last generation of the game possible 
exceptions if you literally have 1 million   titanium you can consider playing a little bit 
before if you have immigrant City technically yes   it will give you like one Mega credit production 
if you got satellites Galilean Waystation the same   it could be something you consider but really it 
should only be if you have like too much titanium   otherwise this one Mega credit production is not 
really what should do it for you but sometimes   it is worth it because the thing is you want 
to be playing this card sooner or later so if   you play it a little bit before and you get one 
Mega credit production it could be worth it also   depends how much discount you have really what 
it comes down to is do you have other better   engine building options available to you if yes 
then play Ganymede colony in the last generation   just for the VP and finally there's of course also 
the mayor Milestone to consider I mean once again   it's really not that important but it could come 
into play that you really want the Mayor Milestone   but you just have to be really careful you don't 
get baited because playing Ganymede Colony just to   get the Mayor Milestone that's like a big hit 
on your economy especially when we're talking   about the early to mid game when it's usually the 
time that the Mayor Milestone is going to claimed   then we've got water import from Europa in 9 
out of 10 games same you want to play this in   the very last generation in the late game now once 
again if you have a lot of titanium then this card   could actually be okay to play a bit sooner the 
thing is you can also spend titanium to use this   action so for 12 Mega Credits or for titanium you 
could build a water so if you have like a million   titanium then of course you want to play this a 
bit earlier just don't get baited into thinking   that it's like really good value because when you 
think about it a TR is worth eight and then the   placement bonus of water is worth around four if 
you're generous and that adds up to 12 so that's   exactly what you're getting with this card so even 
after you build this expensive card for 25 Mega   credits then you just get the action for building 
a water for 12 and that's literally exactly what   a water is worth so it's not that good so just be 
careful you just don't spend 25 Mega credits just   to completely mess up your own engine because you 
think this card should be used to make water it's   really not the point of this card it's really rare 
actually that this card should be used to build   the water usually you should play this in the last 
generation only because of the VP capabilities   but of course it could be that you have some water 
Synergy so water is a little bit better for you in   that case I don't know it's still questionable but 
you know it's something to consider it could also   be that you have Kelp farming or penguins in your 
hand and in that case it could be kind of nice for   you to build some water especially if you're 
thinking about building the standard project   aquifier for 18 Mega credits well then obviously 
this is a better choice but then is it really   because then you also spend 25 Mega credits just 
so you can get water a bit cheaper so it still   has to be a consideration and of course if you are 
going for the terraformer Milestone you're really   close to your opponent then building water makes 
sense then we got terraforming Ganymede in 9 out   of 10 games this should also be played in the last 
generation but terraforming Ganymede is actually   one of the fun cards because if you're having a 
literal God game you can also use this card in   the mid game for its engine building capabilities 
but to be fair this almost never happens I mean   Jovian tags are pretty expensive so when do 
you really have enough Jovian tags played this   early on and on top of that you have to play this 
really expensive card just to get engine it almost   never happens but when it does it actually it's 
really fun I think it would have to be like six   plus Jovian tags you need to have with this so on 
the plus side if we're still in the mid game and   you manage to play this with six Jovian Tags then 
you're getting six TR and that's actually engine   that's like six Mega credit production right so 
that actually does matter but on the other hand   if you later in the game pick up even more Jovian 
tags then you kind of feel a little bit bad that   you played this a bit sooner but it's not that 
simple what you have to consider is is it better   for you to get the mega credit you got for playing 
this in the mid game or is it better for you to   get the let's say plus two victory points because 
you picked up another two Jovian tags by the end   of the game once again if you're fighting for the 
terraformer Milestone this card can actually be a   lot of fun to just play and just snatch that from 
one of your opponents but for this to be worth it   like I said you really have to have like five or 
six Jovian Tags it also works with a benefactor   but that is the award so if you're fighting for 
the benefactor then you still play terraforming   Ganymede in the very last generation because 
then it's like a big surprise Factor oh poop   he's beating me in benefactor I did not expect 
that so when should you go for Jovian Tags if   you get Jovian amplifiers you consider going for 
Jovian Tags you can also collect Jovian tags and   just hope that you'll get a Jovian amplifier later 
on if you do decide to go for Jovian tags maybe   you have a Jovian amplifier in your hand then you 
should really consider keeping most Jovian tags   and I say most is actually not all Jovian tags 
that are worth it to keep even if you're going   for it it depends like on the titanium production 
and is your economy strong enough to build all   of these Jovian maybe you have something better 
you can do so it's not like a given you keep all   Jovian tags just because you have an amplifier 
and regardless even if you're not going for the   Jovian amplifier and the Jovian strategy then 
you should still play the Good Jovian tags some   Jovian tags are pretty strong cards even without 
the amplifiers but to be honest most of the Jovian   cards are actually pretty bad if you do not get 
a Jovian amplifier so most of the bad Jovian   cards you only play if you hope to get a Jovian 
amplifier or maybe you have a Jovian amplifier   in your hand already so like we mentioned Jovian 
amplifiers is a big part of this also if you're   Saturn Systems then of course you're a little bit 
more inclined to go for Jovian Tags in general and   also if you're playing vanilla I think this might 
surprise some people but actually the Jovian tags   and the Jovian strategy is actually better if 
you're playing only vanilla for example if you're   playing on the Mars App it's actually only vanilla 
and also preludes if you bought that one there's a   little bit of cards in Preludes but not that many 
so if you're playing on the Mars App or if you're   playing only with the base game then it's actually 
better to go for Jovian Tags because the chance   to get a Jovian amplifier is bigger in vanilla 
because there are only four Jovian amplifiers   and even with all expansions they added they don't 
add more Jovian amplifiers so there are only the   four of them no matter how many expansions you 
play with so if you're playing with all of the   expansions maybe you have twice as many cards as 
if you're only playing with vanilla so this is   why it's a little bit more likely to get a jovian 
Amplifier if you're playing vanilla worth noting   I'm only talking about amplifiers here Jovian 
tags in general a kind of just as likely to get if   you're playing vanilla or with all the expansions 
because what Stronghold Games does is every time   they release an expansion they add in the same 
percentage of jovian tags to the new expansion so   I'm not talking about Jovian tags I'm only talking 
about the four Jovian amplifiers these four cards   you're more likely to get if you only play vanilla 
of course if you have card-draw then there's a   higher likelihood of you getting an amplifier 
and you really need these amplifiers to make   these jovians worth it this is what I mean when I 
say that the Jovian strategy is usually better in   two or three player games because they're kind 
of longer in terms of generations because if   you're playing a five player game and the game is 
over already on Generation 7 it's actually really   hard to make the Jovian strategy work because 
the jovian tags are so expensive and you just   don't have enough time to collect and play all 
of these expensive Jovian tags finally let's talk   about green Tags I'm talking about animal tags 
microbe tags plant tags now green tag Synergy   can be really good so I'm calling it a strategy 
here but is it really a strategy maybe it's more   like Synergy I mean you can make the argument 
that this entire video is all about Synergy and   not strategies but no matter how your slice it 
green tags can be very powerful so we should talk   about it now green tags that is a mid to late 
game strat it's better for long games and there   are a few reasons for this first of all all of 
the Green Tag amplifiers are like cards you want   to play in the mid game secondly they all like VP 
right so VP cards you usually want to play in the   last half of the game you don't really play a lot 
of green tags in the early game they don't give   you engine and usually you can't even play them 
because of the requirement and stuff like this   and finally animal and micro cards are a big part 
of this and these cards just get better the longer   the game goes because mostly animals and microbes 
are action cards which means that every generation   you can keep adding microbe animals to these 
cards which means that if you get all of this up   and running you really want to play the long game 
because every single generation you just get free   VP from all the action cards animals and microbes 
and stuff like this if you're getting like four   free victory points every generation it's really 
hard for anyone to actually compare with this so   it's definitely in your interest to let the game 
drag out as long as possible and this is also why   I think the green tags in general are like part 
of the card strategy because you want the game   to go long and naturally when you're playing a lot 
of cards when you seeing a lot of cards drawing a   lot of cards you're going to get a lot of green 
tag synergy and the more green tag synergy you   can get the better and also keep in mind the green 
teags can increase in value so when you play these   green tags it's also really important for instance 
Advanced ecosystem it's it's a card that gives you   three victory points usually you play this in 
the last generation because it only gives VP   and on top of that it has three green tags and 
these green tags can be really valuable if you   wait before you play them so for example if you 
have Viral enhancers decomposers and ecological   Zone all of a sudden instead of giving you three 
VP this is like 5vp and three plants and this   value is like insane so if you think about it 5vp 
for 11 Mega credits that's way better value than   you're getting from a jovian amplifier usually and 
Green Tag Synergy is also kind of cool because it   can kind of turn bad cards into good cards so 
for instance we got Adapted Lichen this card   I'm not so crazy about I think it's one of the 
weaker cards in the set like imagine if this card   did not have a plant tag it would be literally 
unplayable so remember the card costs 3 so for   12 Mega credits you get one plant production 
that is horrendous especially considering that   okay you can play this in the early game but 
you don't really want to because in the early   game you need money income and then you play this 
in the mid game and uh the value is bad man yeah   so I'm really sorry but this is not a good card 
however what if you can actually use this plant   tag for something useful maybe you have insects 
or nitrogen-rich asteroid or something like this   then all of a sudden this card could be worth it 
so this is like one of the beauties of this game   that tags matters so much in this game so all of 
a sudden a bad card like this can all of a sudden   become good if you have a lot of green tag synergy 
well to put it in a different way a way that you   zoomers understand well there you go zoomers 
like memes right actually maybe Boomers also   like memes I don't know are memes unpopular no 
they're still popular I think the kids are really   down with the memes these days so maybe it's 
for all of us this is for all of us so instead   of adapted Lichen plus insects it could also be 
like adapted Lichen plus ecological Zone but even   this might not be worth it because then you're 
just getting like another half a point still   questionable but you get my point Adapted Lichen 
bad card but if if you have green tag synergy it   could be a good card so if you're going for this 
green tag Synergy Shenanigans which cards should   you actually be looking out for Meat Industry this 
card is amazing it could also be the GMO contract   which is a Turmoil card or it could also be this 
topsoil contract which is a promo card I actually   thought there was a Pathfinder card so this is why 
they didn't include it initially but this is like   the same idea if you play microbes or if you play 
Animals you get a little bit of stuff and these   cards are like perfect with the card strategy 
where you also go for green tags because like   we talked about this is like how you go GODMODE if 
you get a little bit of stuff every time you play   some of these so every time you do some of this 
it's like a big ingredient of how to go GODMODE   the late game plant cards these cards are of 
course also really good if you're going for green   tags but these cards are like good in general 
so even if you're not going for green tagst   these cards are most of the time still worth it to 
pick up no matter what strategy you're going for   but obviously if you are playing with green text 
these are excellent and you should keep them every   single time also the animal cards of course also 
really good you can maybe even get more animals on   your card especially if the game goes long longer 
and just the fact that this has an animal tag if   you have enough green tag synergy just the animal 
tag alone is worth something for you and like we   talked about if it is the last generation and 
you still haven't managed to play your Birds yet   you can just wait until everyone has passed and 
then you can play this card to just grief one of   your opponents making sure that he cannot build a 
Greenery in the extra round very annoying the only   other thing about animals is that if you have no 
animals you're sad but if you have animals you're   happy how many animals do you have to have on your 
animal card for it to be worth it as a rule you   kinda need like one Victory point on your animal 
cards and then it's like okay but really you want   two or more if you have two Victory point on 
any animal card I don't care which one it is   that is definitely worth it and if you have some 
nice Green Tag Synergy going on then one victory   point on an animal card is plenty because then the 
tag is useful for other purposes and yeah in case   you were wondering this is actually me bringing 
a venusian animal to the dragon roller coaster   in Legoland in Denmark I think exactly one out of 
seven Legoland employees thought this is a good   idea now let's talk about something that's really 
cool and that a lot of people don't think about I   think because everyone likes the Jovian amplifiers 
everyone thinks they're so good and usually yes   they are but so are these cards I think these 
cards are really being slept on so if you're   having a good game and you're playing jovians 
maybe six VP average for the Jovian amplifier   it's it's pretty fair I think sometimes you'll 
get less sometimes you get more 6 VP average is   not far off if you're having a good game this 
number might even be generous but here's the   thing all the Jovian amplifiers these cards are 
really expensive IO mining industries 41 Ganymede   Colony 20 water import from Europa 25 Terraforming 
Ganymede 33 really expensive so what I think a lot   of people fail to realize is that they're only 
going for Jovian amplifiers but the green tags   these can give just as much victory points and 
usually the cards are a lot cheaper so let's   actually compare some of these now first of all 
all of these numbers I'm coming up with here they   are not based in anything scientific at all these 
are literally just numbers I'm pulling out of my   black hole and these are simply numbers I come up 
with based on my experience and my thoughts and my   feelings there's nothing to do with science 
that being said we should still do the math   and some of these because it's a lot of fun and 
also it's quite eye-opening I think so imported   nitrogen it comes with one TR so that's one and 
then you get three microbes you can put it on   ants that's one and a half and then you have two 
animals that's another two points if you put it on   birds or something so even without considering 
the plants that's four and a half points so in   the right circumstance imported nitrogen could be 
worth maybe seven points maybe five pounds is even   a bit low here but seven points is also completely 
reasonable if you can use the plants then we got   large Convoy this card is also really good if you 
have an animal card where animals are worth one   per animal so if we do the math the card comes 
with two victory points then we have the water   that's one Victory point and then we have the 
four animals so that's a total of seven Victory   points and two cards just for this card so cards 
like these and also stuff like Miranda this is why   it's really important to have at least one cards 
where the animals are worth one Victory Point per   animal and worth noting with the large Convoy in 
my experience if you don't have one of these cards   if you only have one of the animals like pets 
where they don't give half a point per animal then   more often than not it's actually better to just 
take the five plants and build a Greenery I think   if you do take the four animals from this card 
it really has to be on fish or Predators or some   other cards that gives you one Victory Point per 
animal a little bit of a fun combo that I tried   once or twice is like actually using large Convoy 
on Martian zoo and the idea here is that then the   four animals is actually equal to four Mega credit 
production so is it good nah I'm not sure but it's   it's a bit fun so you get the four animals which 
is kind of like four Mega credit production on the   Martian Zoo then you get two cards which could be 
kind of nice in the early game then you also get   a water so you can get even more cards it's 
just a funny combo I just wanted to mention   but usually you should play the large Convoy in 
the last generation or maybe a little bit sooner   if you want to get the last water before that 
parameter closes completely and then you should   use it on fish or something so really this combo 
is like a classic but it's a classic a good reason   because if you have fish and large Convoy it's 
seven victory points at the end of the game and   also you get two cards really good then we got 
viral enhancers I think a lot of people really   don't appreciate how good this card is but worth 
noting this card is only good if you go for green   tags and if you have a lot of green tag synergy 
going on if you got no green tags of course this   is a bad card it's a waste of nine gold but it 
really doesn't take much to get this card worth   it let's say you have fish in your hand or you're 
planning to go for green tags maybe you have like   a Ecological zone or just Advanced ecosystem is 
plenty the thing about Viral Enhancers is it's   so cheap it comes with a science tag and just when 
you play the card just then you get one plant but   all of these are like hidden bonuses it's easier 
to understand at the end of the game oh my Jovian   amplifier I won because that gave me eight victory 
points but maybe Viral enhancers gave you just as   much you just didn't think about it like all the 
plants and all the extra animals and microbes and   stuff it really does add up it's a very good card 
so I put on five Victory points here for viral   enhancers and to be fair that's only if you're 
having a really good game with a lot of Green Tag   Synergy you could also make an argument for maybe 
three victory points but then you also get like a   lot of plants maybe eight plants or something so 
then we're back to five anyway right because like   we mentioned this card is also a plant amplifier 
sort out I mean you really can't underestimate   how many green tags there are especially if 
you're going for green tags and you also can't   underestimate the value of the flexibility 
sometimes you just really need one plant or   two plants so you can build a Greenery then you 
could just play decomposers and instead of taking   the microbe you can take the one plant and then 
you can build a Greenery it's perfect Herbivores   I just placed it on four victory points this is 
a card where every time you place a Greenery you   get an animal on this card worth like half a point 
so to get to four victory points you kind of need   to have placed seven greeneries after playing 
this card because remember the card already   comes with one animal so this is probably only 
happening if you have a lot of plant production   and stuff like this but even if herbivores only 
gives you two victory points it's probably still   worth it because remember the card costs three so 
that's 15 total you're paying for this in the last   generation that's still good enough considering 
that a VP in the last generation is eight so if   you're getting 2(VP) for 15 that's a little better 
than 2(VP) for 16 and on top of that you get to   decrease someone's plant production which is also 
kind of nice then we got venusian animals and   this card is really good this is only if you're 
playing with the Venus expansion but I have had   games I'm not kidding where this card just gave 
me like 20 victory points this card can be really   good if you've got a lot of science tags and the 
thing is a lot of the Science Tags you can just   keep and then you can play them after you play 
venusian animals so kind of what you do is the   important Science Tags the really high impact 
science tags just play them as soon as possible   Right but a lot of the Science Tags it doesn't 
really matter if you play them now or you play   them later so really you're just holding a lot of 
science tags in your hand and then when you can   finally play Venusian animals then you can play 
all of these Science tags so if you can manage to   play it and you have a lot of Science Tags this 
is amazing but the thing is this is 18 Venus on   the Venus scale and that is really hard because 
it's really hard to predict when your opponents   are actually going to terraform Venus Venus is not 
one of the three parameters you need to close the   game unless you play with this optional rule that 
you also need Venus to close the game but usually   people don't do this usually it's only water 
oxygen and temperature so let's assume Venus   is not one of the global parameters you need 
to close the game in that case it's so hard to   predict if people are actually going to terraform 
Venus so likely you actually have two terraform   Venus a lot yourself in order to play this card 
so this is where this card gets a little bit more   fair it's not completely overpowered because 
sometimes the 18 Venus is extremely hard but   if it is 18 Venus and you got this and you've 
got a lot of Science Tags go for it it's amazing   you'll get so much value then we got an advanced 
ecosystem and like I said if you have decomposers   ecological Zone easy that's five points right 
there decomposers is really cheap but if you're   going for green tags I don't think it's out of the 
question that you have like three Victory Points   of this card so that would be like nine microbes 
you've gathered on this card and I think that's   entirely plausible and then we got ecological 
Zone I just put five Victor points I don't think   that's entirely unreasonable remember the card 
already comes with two tags so all you need is   to get another eight green tags and then you're 
up to your five victory points on this card I   don't think that's entirely out of the question so 
these are like sort of the average values I mean   once again I don't have any science at all to 
back this up but all I'm saying is look at this   amplifier over here six victory points average and 
then look at these cards over here it's almost as   good and these are a lot cheaper so all I'm saying 
is do not underestimate these Victory Point cards   on the Green Tag strategy these can be just as 
impactful as the Jovian amplifiers in fact let   me show you a print screen here of the game I had 
on the Mars App obviously this was like a god game   so I'm getting like a lot of green tag synergies 
and my points are quite crazy here but this is   just an example to show you how much stuff you can 
actually get so if you do the math on this this   sets up to 54 victory points I get just by having 
stuff on top of my cards and okay you could argue   that security Fleet, physics complex is not really 
green tags okay so let's say 47 but that's like if   you're having a good Jovian amplifier game it's 
probably not even 47 right and worth noting this   is on the Mars App so this is like only vanilla 
and Prelude so if you're playing like in real life   it's not unheard of it actually happens pretty 
often that I have more than 100 victory points   on top of my cards mainly from Green tags but also 
stuff like security fleets and floaters and stuff   like this and on the Mars app I've had other games 
where I've gotten even more points than this on   green tags but this is just the only game like I 
had available anyway it's not important the point   I'm trying to get across here is that I think 
that green tags can be just as good as Jovian   amplifiers if not better other cards you should 
be looking for when you're playing for green   tags also of course these plant amplifiers these 
cards can be really good and there's a little bit   of synergy going on especially with herbivores 
and stuff so the more Greenery you get down the   more animals you get with this card there is a 
little bit of synergy here but there's also a   little bit of anti-synergy because the thing is 
when you're going for green tags oh I'm gonna   make Mars a better place it's got the green there 
are going to be animals plants it's gonna be great   and you're kind of feel inclined to like make 
this beautiful Green Planet but really it's in   your best interest to let the game drag out so 
the anti-synergy I'm talking about here is maybe   you don't want to put as many greeneries to close 
the game as normally because then you're actively   helping to close the game but I think this is only 
like a minor consideration you could think about   it if oxygen is the last parameter to close maybe 
it's in my best interest to let the game drag out   a little bit but usually just play the plants play 
the green tags you should be fine Ecology Research   we talked about on the last generation(video lol) 
I think this card is amazing I might just play a   lot of colonies and slam this card get a bunch 
of plant production but especially when we're   talking about Green Tag Synergy look at what 
this card actually gives you it gives you three   green tags it gives you an animal and it gives 
you two microbes needless to say if you have a   lot of Green Tag Synergy this can also be a lot 
of victory points on top of the plant production   you're getting then we got nitrogen-rich asteroid 
and the thing is I think I've always been hyping   up insects but this card is actually also really 
good this card it might look pretty expensive but   it actually gives you three terraform rating 
so even if you don't have the plant tags you   need to fulfill the requirement here just getting 
three terraform rating and one plant production   for 31 that's an okay deal I mean it's not great 
if you do the math on it a terraform rating is   worth eight so if you're getting three of those 
as 24 and then you play 34 for the card because   remember the cast costs three so that leaves 10 
mega credits that you're then using to get one   plant production it's not that bad it's still 
better than adaptive lichen cost nine but then   the card of three so that's 12 so still two better 
than adaptive lichen and the math that's even just   for one plant production if you actually get three 
plant tags and you can get the 4 plant production   from this card that's insanely good so these are 
also cards I want to look out for when I play   The Green Tag Synergy and then of course we have 
protected habitat always when we are having plan   production protected habitat is really good it's 
also good for the Green Tag strategy because when   you're playing this usually you have microbes 
and animals and protected habitats also prevent   enemies from removing those so protected habitat 
is definitely a card I would value very highly   if I go for green tags like look at virus just 
removes two of your fish that hurts man not to   mention the action cards that also can remove your 
animals or your plants so we got predators or ants   so protected habitat it just really feels good to 
play this card when you're going for Green Tags so   we talked a lot about animals but don't sleep on 
microbes either these can also be quite impactful   so there are two microbes where the microbes are 
worth half a point per microbe and that ants and   venusian insects venusian insects is only if you 
play with the Venus expansion and once again 12   Venus that's also pretty rough so it's not that 
often you see this card but if you do get these   cards then in the mid game or the late game it 
could be quite nice for you to actually build   a colony on Enceladus so that you once or twice 
can put a lot of microbes on these cards it can   be quite a lot of points Ants does require you 
to take a microbe from another the card but it   can be from one of your opponents but even if the 
opponents do not have a microbe to take you can   still take it from one of your bad micro cards you 
can just steal from tardigrades or ghg producing   bacteria some trash like this another interesting 
card I also want to put some attention to here   is sulphur-eating bacteria this card is actually 
kind of cool it requires you to have six percent   Venus so it's not that hard to get but sometimes 
it's a little bit punishing a little bit annoying   but if you get this card and you also have the 
Enceladus Colony out there then it's actually   kind of your own personal Luna in a sense because 
if you think about it all the microbes are worth   three Mega credits per microbe so if you have a 
colony here and you trade when it's Maxed that's   like six microbes so that's 18 gold so if you can 
get this down in the early game you're likely the   only one who will have microbes around the table 
this early on and when that happens then this is   like your own personal Luna but not only that it's 
also completely uncontested you're the only one   who's going to fly here it's just another 
little fun combo that I play sometimes it   feels really good when you play it but if we are 
talking about the mid to late game probably Ants,   Venusian Insects are better with Enceladus or 
it could also be that you have extreme-cold   fungus this card is also actually really nice in 
conjunction with these two because the action of   extreme-cold fungus that alone is like one free 
Victory Point every generation that's pretty good   and also we got this sort of new promo card here 
Bactoviral research again if you have a lot of   science tags this can actually give a lot of 
stuff so this is pretty cool as well it also   gives you one card which is nice so microbe cards 
are really good if you can get microbes on these   cards but of course if you cannot they're useless 
so how to improve your chances of getting a lot of   Green Tag Synergy and get all the combo pieces 
you need to make this go absolutely insane once   again card-draw is really nice it makes sense the 
more cards you get the more cards you will see the   more green tags you will get and the more Synergy 
you can build and once again try to make sure that   the game drags out a little bit because when the 
game goes long in terms of generations then you'll   have more time to collect all the microbes and 
all the animals and all the free victory points   you get every generation and this one is really 
important get any animal card worth one Victory   point per animal I don't care which it is but 
just get one and the reason of course is there's   so many effects in this game that just can give 
an animal to another card so having one of these   animals worth one Victory Point per animal is 
really important and also keep all the good green   tags especially the green tags that could end up 
giving you a lot of victory points is like keeping   a jovian amplifier sometimes it's worth it even 
if it's in the early game but it's not only these   Victory Point amplifiers it could be any of the 
green tags we talked about in this chapter it like   all of them could be really good but of course 
like we talked about in the first video if you   pick up a card in the early game and you're not 
gonna use it until much later make sure that your   economy can handle it otherwise you can really 
tank yourself yeah that's pretty much it for this   episode thanks so much for watching as always 
if you have anything you want to debate with   me in the comments if you have any nice things I 
forgot about make sure to write it I'll be game to   discuss any of this with you and I promise 
the next video is gonna be shorter I promise
