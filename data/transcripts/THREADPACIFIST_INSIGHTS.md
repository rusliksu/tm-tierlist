## Video 1: Thoth the Raven Review (Ecoline vs Phobolog)
**ID:** `_qvplXujIrQ`

### Card Evaluations

| Card | Rating | Context |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Experimental Forest** | Always take | With Ecoline especially -- free plant tag search |
| **AAA (Acquired Space Agency)** | Situational | "Not a card I love, but it has its place" -- good with Ecoline for free card draws |
| **Allied Banks** | Good default | "Mediocre but good -- you can't go wrong having MC prod" |
| **Supplier** | Situational | Steel not useful without targets; Allied Banks preferred as safer pick |
| **Mineral Deposit** | Cuttable | "Five steel is really just +2 cash... not skip-good-cards-to-keep-it level" |
| **Industrial Center** | Underrated | "People on BGA absolutely love cities" -- good for teleport/city play |
| **Arctic Algae** | S-tier | "Too good" even when 3 oceans already down -- always take |
| **Lake Marinerys** | Strong hedge | "Hedging your bets" -- good with AAA early; 4 points for 21 + ocean rebates |
| **NRA (Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid)** | Priority play | "NRA is kind of our game plan here" -- major scoring priority |
| **AI Central** | Context-dependent bait | "No science tags in hand, plant solved, ocean solved, heat solved -- it's bait" |
| **Immigrant City** | Decent later | "Not something we have to play right away... okay to play later" |
| **Standard Technology** | Good for pushing | Better than Trees for pushing game out |
| **Trees** | Controllable | "Wait till most the oxygen's gone and trees is not that impactful" |
| **Research Outpost** | Marginal | "Not meaningfully better than Immigrant City" late in game |
| **Birds** | Must-cut from opponent | "Always cut the one-point animal if it's a mediocre card on the other side" |
| **Security Fleet** | Weak efficiency | "15+16=31 for 4 points. A point for 8 -- not great" |
| **Large Convoy** | Distraction | "A nice card... but NRA is our game plan. Large convoy is a distraction" |
| **Black Polar Dust** | Skip if hand busy | "Playing it is going to delay another gen of NRA and Arctic Algae" |
| **Sabotage** | Strong vs titanium corps | Good to hit Phobolog's titanium -- "pretty big cash swing" |
| **Fish** | Stall tool | Can use to stall a bit in endgame |

### Draft Decisions & Reasoning
- **Always take power cards in opening hand** -- Experimental Forest is auto-keep with Ecoline
- **Prelude priority:** Allied Banks over Supplier when steel targets are missing
- **Cut one-point animals from opponent:** "Always cut the one-point animal"
- **Don't give discounts to discount corps:** "Definitely do not give a guy with Earth Catapult AI Central"
- **Land Claim priority:** "100% here" to block ocean rebate areas vs aggressive opponent

### Economy Benchmarks
- Gen 1 with Ecoline: Need enough cash to play 1-2 cheap cards after preludes
- NRA timing: Ideally Gen 4-5, requires 3 plant tags + ocean accessibility
- Lake Marinerys value: 4 VP for 21 MC + ocean rebates = strong mid-game play

### Common Mistakes
- **Not claiming milestones when close:** "Getting shut out when we're so close to Terraformer is not great"
- **SP greenery instead of waiting:** "Not convinced on standard greenery for the conversion... would have just waited"
- **Playing Eco Zone before O2 maxes:** "Listen to the opponent... do it before the oxygen maxes because you just lost the point for that delay"
- **Not stalling when behind on Jovians:** When uncertain, lean towards SP city line instead of forcing game end

### Corporation Evaluations
- **Ecoline:** One of the best corps in the game (explicitly stated)
- **Phobolog:** "One of the worst corps in the game" -- but finding IO Mining off ASA is disgusting value

## Video 2: Guess the ELO -- Dcoin vs Koolik (Chungking vs Mining Guild)
**ID:** `1aXpxHv2Xjc`

### Card Evaluations

| Card | Rating | Context |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Chungking** | Almost always pick | "Almost always stronger than Inventrix" |
| **Water Splitting Plant** | Interesting combo | With Great Aquifer + Power Generation = online Gen 2 for O2 pumping |
| **Business Network** | Auto-take | "Makes too much sense not to take" |
| **Olympus Conference** | Generically good | Always good early |
| **Mining Rights** | Duh with Chungking | Auto-take with building discount |
| **GIA (Giant Ice Asteroid)** | Duh | "You're going to take these" |
| **Power Plant** | Efficient with Chungking | "Power plants just too efficient to pass up with Chungking" -- always like 2-3 power prod |
| **Aquifer Pumping** | Situational | "No way on earth we're playing aquifer pumping" when oceans accounted for |
| **Regular Theaters** | Awful | "Just a bad card" |
| **Mars University** | Must-take/never pass | "You always got to take Marsu" -- giving opponent Mars U = dangerous |
| **Lightning Harvest** | Cycle candidate | Can cycle if hand already has science |
| **Natural Preserve** | Cut from mining guild | "You don't want to give mining guild a natural preserve" |
| **Eco Zone** | Critical cut | "You don't want to give the guy with viral enhancers and decomposers advanced eco zone" |
| **Big Asteroid** | Critical plant swing | "The swing in points from big asteroid killing 4 plants, that's an 8 plant swing -- at least 2 points. Plus you get 2 points from TR" |
| **Interstellar Colony Ship** | Weaker than Big Asteroid | Worse pick when plant destruction is available |
| **Heather** | Good with Eco Zone | "With ecozone and insects, I lean towards Heather now" |
| **Standard Tech** | Strong for science combos | Good even without Eco Zone for science chains |

### Draft Decisions & Reasoning
- **Mining Guild draft strategy:** "Always cut the steel dumps when the other card sucks"
- **Card draw priority vs Mining Guild:** Having more card draw than opponent matters -- limit his options
- **Power Plant hoarding:** "I always like to have 2-3 power prod on hand if possible"
- **ELO tells:** "Lack of SP cities is usually a problem you see in lower ranks" -- good players avoid excessive SP cities

### Economy Benchmarks
- **Mining Guild threat level:** 8+ steel prod by mid-game = unstoppable if unchecked
- **Gen 3 plays:** Both Deep Well Heating AND Giant Space Mirror affordable with Chungking discount
- **Sabotage on Mining Guild:** "Always hit money for mining guild" -- cash more important than steel for them
- **Big Asteroid value:** ~4 points for 15 MC net (after rebates) = excellent efficiency

### Common Mistakes
- **Sabotaging Mining Guild's steel instead of cash:** "Mining guild already has too much steel to handle -- cash is far more important"
- **Buying AOS without animal in hand:** "What's AOS getting us without an animal in hand?"
- **Playing Capital with no power:** "Not a card I would buy with no power in hand"
- **Not ordering Earth Office before Olympus Conference:** "You'd be surprised how many people forget"
- **SP ocean into opponent's Kelp Farming:** Avoid giving free plant production triggers

### Corporation Evaluations
- **Chungking:** Top tier -- "one of the stronger corps... same tier as Credit, Vitor, Ecoline"
- **Mining Guild:** Very strong, especially with card draw + steel dumps; Advanced Alloys makes them unstoppable
- **Inventrix:** Slightly interesting for Water Splitting Plant combo, but usually inferior to Chungking

## Video 3: Arena Championship Decider (Terractor + EarthCat vs Vitor/JD)
**ID:** `4wYMIjIK-bs`

### Card Evaluations

| Card | Rating | Context |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Earth Catapult** | Obvious power card | Auto-take, defines the game plan |
| **Terractor** | Strong with Earth tags | Picked over UNMI; Earth tag discount is key |
| **Cleta** | Strong with Miranda Resort | Enables 10 MC prod Gen 2; lunar beam combo |
| **Lunar Beam** | Strong early | Good for heat prod; plays well into terraforming control |
| **Convoy from Europa** | Skip when oceans contested | "18 for a card and an ocean -- not really appealing" without prelude ocean |
| **Psychopiles** | Good | Free with EarthCat-level discounts |
| **Media Group** | Amazing with discounts | "One mega credit card that gives you 3 MC back every time you play event -- yes please" |
| **Miranda Resort** | Snap pick | "Four Earth tags. Miranda Resort right there. That's sick" -- massive prod |
| **Advanced Ecosystems** | No-brainer | With psychopiles for micro tag; easy to complete |
| **Corporate Stronghold** | Overvalued by players | "Overvaluing production -- losing energy for -2 VP and just 3 MC, not good" |
| **Physics Complex** | "Forbidden" 12 points | With 12 power prod -- 2 VP per gen; combined with caretaker = game winner |
| **Caretaker Contract** | Excellent with power engine | Converts excess heat to VP reliably |
| **IO Mining Industries** | Bait Gen 7 | "JD playing IO Mining Industries Gen 7 -- that's crazy... I do not think that is right" |
| **Power Grid** | Meme but effective | 6 power with Space Mirrors = "doing that, you better believe" |
| **Mass Converter** | Context-dependent bait | "Too much power" when already at 13 power and no Power Infrastructure |
| **Bribe Committee** | Decent prod card | "2 for 2 prod" with EarthCat discount; helps reach Terraformer |
| **TG (Terraforming Ganymede)** | Never pass to opponent | "Don't give him TG for sabotage -- no way that's right" |
| **Optimal Aerobraking** | Critical keep | "Got to take the optimal aero breaking" -- don't pass to opponent with events |
| **Investment Loan** | Strong with media group | "With media group, I think you got to take investment loan" |

### Draft Decisions & Reasoning
- **Information hiding:** Don't play Media Group early -- "you're telling your opponent I really want event cards"
- **Dev Center reveals:** "SP power screams that I have Dev Center" -- be aware of telegraphing
- **EarthCat with discount stacking:** Cleta + Lunar Beam + EarthCat = massive discount engine Gen 2
- **10-point milestone flip:** "Having a 10-point flip is just really strong" -- worth SP city to secure
- **Fund thermalist when winning heat massively:** 27 heat vs 6 heat = safe fund

### Economy Benchmarks
- **EarthCat Terractor Gen 2:** 10 MC prod -- "pretty good"
- **Power engine peak:** 12 power prod enables Physics Complex (2 VP/gen) + Caretaker (1 VP/gen)
- **Thermalist safety margin:** Need +7 heat/gen lead minimum for safe fund
- **"SP city is bad" exception:** When it secures a milestone in tight game = correct play

### Common Mistakes
- **Playing Power Plant when Dev Center is accounted for:** "No reason to float power... susceptible to energy tapping"
- **Ice Asteroid into Kelp Farming:** "Playing right into kelp farming -- I would not want to do that"
- **Spending all steel early as Vitor:** "Does he have another source for steel? Two steel not great"
- **Molehole Area on two steel:** Bad placement when better spots exist
- **IO Mining Gen 7 with low titanium synergy:** Too expensive, delays important plays
- **Forgetting SP Ocean when game should end:** "Oops I forgot about the ocean" -- critical counting error
- **Passing TG for Sabotage:** Free sabotage not worth giving 5-point card to opponent with IO Mining

### Corporation Evaluations
- **Terractor:** Strong with EarthCat; Earth tag discount engine
- **UNMI:** "Giving up 26 cash is too much" -- not viable when Earth discount available
- **Vitor:** Fund obligation Gen 1; good with Landlord + NRA but needs card draw

## Video 4: JMC vs Clumpy Tie Game (Chungking vs Mining Guild)
**ID:** `70XUEgUN0ZQ`

### Card Evaluations

| Card | Rating | Context |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Chungking** | S-tier | "Such a strong corporation... roughly same tier as Credit, Vitor, Ecoline" |
| **Antigravity Technology** | Power card | "Obviously Antigrav is a power card" -- defines the hand |
| **Protected Valley** | Always amazing early | "Always amazing early" |
| **Lava Flows** | Above average | "Always an above average performer" |
| **ICS (Interplanetary Cinematics)** | Borderline keep | "Borderline... I just think I would have taken it" for antigrav progress |
| **Lake Marinerys** | Strong | "Good" -- especially when oceans may lag |
| **Commercial District** | Better with Chungking | "Not so good normally, but with Chungking more argument for it" |
| **Society Reducing Support** | Terrible | Data: "359 average ELO plays it, lose about 1 ELO on average" |
| **Eccentric Sponsor** | Weaker with Chungking | "It's discounted by 2 anyway -- basically just donation" |
| **Dome Farming** | Good for plant tag | "One reason you take it is that plant tag can be really valuable" |
| **Security Fleet** | "Pretty awful" | From ASA hit -- not good enough |
| **NRA** | Auto-take near plant tags | "Too much value early when you're already so close on the plant tags" |
| **Dev Center** | Cut from Mining Guild | "You don't want to give mining guild card draw" |
| **Insects** | Strong for prod | "Insects for 6 prod is wild" |
| **Adventurers Guild** | Take over Large Convoy | "On the science train... don't give mining guild card draw with Mars U" |
| **Birds** | Strong but timing matters | "Come down sad but really not much way of playing around that" |
| **Predators** | "Snap pick" | "With viral enhancers and no protected habs... snap pick" |
| **Tundra Farming** | Bad | "Tundra farming is a bad card. Everyone say it with me" |
| **Kelp Farming** | Bait late | "Just animal bait at this point" when taken too late |
| **Urbanized Area** | Critical for long games | "Cities going to become very important... really want urbanized area" |
| **Ganymede Colony** | Keep vs pass | "If I just got TG and Ganymede Colony was passed, I would not give it back" |

### Draft Decisions & Reasoning
- **SP ocean for Nitro Moss:** "I understand what Jay is doing -- I don't agree. I would leave oceans open to encourage Mining Guild to place them"
- **Always take Indentured Workers vs media group:** "You should always take indentured workers" to deny combo value
- **Virus timing:** "Would not have virused that -- waited for more value" -- don't waste on 3 plants
- **Jove hoarding strategy:** "Hold Jovians and worst case Mars U cycles, best case just play them and score"
- **Mineral deposit vs Mining Guild:** "Valuable for being able to play around miner" even though it's Mining Guild

### Economy Benchmarks
- **Mining Guild with Electro Cat + Mars U + Alloys:** "That is brutal" -- uncontrollable card draw + mineral value
- **Chungking Gen 1:** 9 MC production with Allied Banks + Dome Farming
- **SP city cost:** "Yeah you do want a city at some point... but there's something better that could come along"
- **Minor fund math:** Track minerals carefully -- one more steel can decide the game by 1 MC

### Common Mistakes
- **Spending 36 MC on SP oceans early for Nitro Moss:** Telegraphs your plan to good opponent
- **Not keeping Urbanized Area:** "Cities are going to become very important" in long ground games
- **Heat Trappers when biomass available:** "If I was going to boost power for physics complex, it would be biomass not heat trappers -- minus VP twice is wrong"
- **One more steel matters:** "One more steel would have won Jay the game by 1 MC" -- count minerals precisely in endgame
- **Not respecting Joves passed to opponent:** "Jay does not respect the joves -- I think that's a mistake"
- **Kelp Farming too late:** Just becomes animal bait, not conversion enabler

### Corporation Evaluations
- **Chungking:** Confirmed S-tier again; global discount matters enormously
- **Helion:** "Not that exciting compared to Chungking's just discount on all the steel" even with Lunar Beam
- **Mining Guild:** "You don't need infinite steel -- 8 steel prod and he's like what would I do with more steel" -- card draw > more steel at some point

## Video 5: Top 100 Tournament Finals (Hellas Map, ThreadPacifist vs Jesse #1 ELO)
**ID:** `7qmuWxUKQWg`

### Card Evaluations

| Card | Rating | Context |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Giant Ice Asteroid** | Always take | "I think you should take giant ice asteroid always" |
| **Mass Converter** | Always take | "I think you should take mass converter always" |
| **Allied Banks** | Always take | "You should always take Allied Banks" |
| **Advanced Alloys** | Game-defining | "Advanced alloys in your opening hand might be strong guys" -- pattern across multiple games |
| **Self-Sufficient Settlement** | Milestone enabler | "Helps on diversifier and polar explorer" -- take for milestone math |
| **Robo Workforce** | Cut from Mining Guild | "Terrifying -- don't give him robo workforce" -- copies power for card draw |
| **Restricted Area** | Best card for rich opponents | "Like the best card in the game for him right now outside AI Central" |
| **Physics Complex** | Strong with mass converter | Restricted Area + Physics + Mass Converter = strong scaling engine |
| **Mars University** | Never pass | "We don't give this guy Mars U -- instant game over with Olympus Conference" |
| **Predators** | Scales well late | "One of those cards that scales so well in later parts" -- take over Koopa City |
| **Aquifer Pumping** | Strong for rich corps | Mining Guild with infinite steel = free points per use |
| **Land Claim** | Underappreciated | "Minus two points is pretty good" -- blocks key positions |
| **Asteroid Mining** | Bait Gen 10 | "Gen 10, too ambitious" -- should respect opponent's huge cash pile |
| **Kalisto Penal Mines** | Skip without Jove Molts | "Mistake -- no Jovian Molt in hand, should just keep him from getting free 2-point card" |
| **Radkim** | Cut from opponent | "Free two points for him -- should have cut Radkim" |
| **Arctic Algae** | Very happy to see | "Very happy to see that" -- plays well with ocean timing |
| **Protected Habs** | Insurance play | "Play before imported nitrogen in case of Damos" from titanium-heavy opponent |
| **Wave Power** | Situational 1 VP | "Only choice" when hand is empty |
| **Decomposers** | Enables eccentric fund | Opens award funding possibility |

### Draft Decisions & Reasoning
- **AMC (Asteroid Mining Consortium) gambit:** First-pick AMC, force opponent to choose between heat trappers and space elevator -- "whichever he chooses, I win by getting the other back"
- **One-actioning for timing:** "I am a one-action dirty rotten cheater" -- legitimate in tournament, forces opponent to show cards
- **Buying cards to cycle:** Mars U cycling is valuable, but "buying 4 is a bit greedy when money is tight"
- **Physics vs Arctic Algae priority:** "Physics mass was more impactful than Arctic algae" -- should prioritize engine over opportunistic plants
- **Protected Habs pre-play:** "Worried about Damos potential" with 28 titanium sitting around

### Economy Benchmarks
- **Mining Guild with Advanced Alloys:** 30 MC production in steel by Gen 5-6; "richer than Elon Musk"
- **Mining Guild threat:** "24 MC prod and steel, he probably doesn't need more -- goes for cards now"
- **Physics Complex + Mass Converter:** "Plus one point net" compared to raising heat, but slows game = less SP time for opponent
- **Award fund math:** Can't fund if opponent can outspend you -- need clear lead in category
- **Passive scoring:** "3 points a turn" from predators + physics + animals = strong late-game engine
- **Advanced Alloys pattern:** "I've noticed a pattern -- Advanced Alloys with mineral prod is a very strong start. Favorite to win"

### Common Mistakes
- **Buying Jovian cards without Jovian Molts:** "9 cash on asteroid mining, Kalisto, Miranda, never playing any -- waiting for Jove Molt = sloppy"
- **Arctic Algae before Physics/Mass Converter:** "This was probably a little bit wrong -- should not have rushed out Arctic Algae"
- **Not taking Land Claim:** "Should have done land claim and restricted area then lava flows elsewhere"
- **Playing Ary over Physics Complex:** "Being too greedy" and playing too fast -- should have played physics
- **Keeping B-fat without intent to play:** "No reason to take B-fat here" -- example of being too greedy

### Corporation Evaluations
- **Mining Guild on Hellas:** "Stats don't say better, but I feel like better on this map -- premium juicy spots + snowball potential"
- **Helion (Hellas):** Viable with Saturn Systems for Rim Settler milestone, but hand-dependent
- **Mining Guild + Advanced Alloys:** "Richer than Elon Musk and able to end the game whenever he wanted" -- near-unstoppable combination

## Cross-Video Strategic Principles

### Card Tier Observations (ThreadPacifist's implied ratings)

**S-Tier (Always take):**
- Giant Ice Asteroid, Mass Converter, Mars University, Arctic Algae, NRA, Earth Catapult, Advanced Alloys

**A-Tier (Strong, nearly always keep):**
- Allied Banks, Olympus Conference, Business Network, Physics Complex, Predators, Restricted Area, Media Group (with discounts), Lake Marinerys, Insects, Eco Zone

**Bait Cards (Context-dependent, often wrong to take):**
- AI Central (no science tags/no time), IO Mining Industries (Gen 7+), Mass Converter (when already at 13+ power), Security Fleet (inefficient), Aquifer Pumping (oceans accounted for), Tundra Farming ("everyone say it with me")

**Always Cut from Opponent:**
- Mars University, Birds/1-point animals, Dev Center, Card draw engines, Robo Workforce (vs Mining Guild), Steel dumps (vs Mining Guild)

### Draft Principles
1. **"Always cut the one-point animal if it's a mediocre card on the other side"**
2. **Never pass card draw to Mining Guild** -- Dev Center, Restricted Area, Mars U are top priority cuts
3. **Hit Mining Guild's cash, not steel** -- "They already have too much steel to handle"
4. **Information hiding matters** -- don't reveal Media Group or event preference early
5. **Play Earth Office before Olympus Conference** -- ordering matters for discounts
6. **Fund awards only when clearly winning that category** -- track margins carefully
7. **One-actioning is legitimate** -- especially in tournaments for timing advantage

### Economy Principles
1. **2-3 power prod is ideal early** -- "You always find some use for power"
2. **SP city is bad... except when it secures a milestone** -- 10-point swing worth 23 MC
3. **Count minerals in endgame** -- games decided by 1 MC / 1 steel difference
4. **Passive scoring > terraforming rush** when opponent has more cash
5. **Thermalist fund safety:** Need +7 heat/gen lead minimum
6. **Advanced Alloys + mineral prod = "favorite to win"** -- consistent pattern across games

### Common Mistake Patterns
1. **Telegraphing plans** (SP ocean for Nitro Moss, SP power for Dev Center)
2. **Not respecting Jovians** -- passing TG and Ganymede Colony back is dangerous
3. **Buying cards you never play** -- "incremental game, mediocre cards early can haunt you"
4. **Rushing out cards instead of engine pieces** -- Arctic Algae before Physics/Mass = slight mistake
5. **Not counting minerals/steel for award fights** -- one-steel difference decides games
6. **Playing too fast** -- ThreadPacifist admits "being tired" and "playing faster than I should" cost him

### Corporation Power Rankings (implied)
1. **S-Tier:** Ecoline, Credicor, Vitor, Chungking (roughly equivalent)
2. **A-Tier:** Terractor (with Earth tags), Mining Guild (with card draw)
3. **Context-dependent:** Helion, Inventrix, UNMI
4. **Weak:** Phobolog ("one of the worst corps in the game")
