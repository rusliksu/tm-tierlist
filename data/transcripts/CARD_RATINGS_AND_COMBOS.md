## A. Card Ratings & Evaluations

### S-Tier / God-Tier Cards

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| AI Central | One of the best cards in the game (2P), top-tier in GODMODE | 4 cards/gen with Viron; expensive (21 MC + 1 energy + 3 science) but absurd value in long games. In 5P can be too greedy. |
| Olympus Conference | "Best card in the game when going for card strategy" | Exponentially better with more card draw. Science tag synergy makes even bad science tags worth keeping. |
| Mars University | One of the best card-draw cards | Cycle bad cards, get new ones. Especially strong in 2P long games. "Literally never had a bad game" when combined with Olympus Conference. |
| Earth Catapult | Top-tier discount card | -2 MC on all cards. Discount cards stack exponentially. |
| Kelp Farming | Best plant card for Ecology Experts combo | "No case where I would not keep this in my opening hand." 2 MC-prod + 4 plant-prod + 2 plants + 2 plant tags. |
| Anti-Gravity Technology | Top-tier greedy card (2P) | Extremely good in 2P, risky in 5P. Requires science setup. |
| Ecology Research | Strategy-changing card (colonies) | "I might just seriously change my strategy." Combo with Standard Tech + Poseidon = "crushed everyone." |
| Indentured Workers | "Literally always keep in opening hand" | 5+ MC effective value with accumulated interest. Negative VP irrelevant early game. |
| Medical Lab | Magnificent with Robotic Workforce | "One of the best combos in vanilla Mars." Great engine building with building tags. |
| Robotic Workforce | Top combo piece | Copies brown box of building cards. Best with Medical Lab, Gyropolis. |

### A-Tier / Very Strong Cards

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Insects | S-tier amplifier with goat | "S-tier cards with a goat." Resource amplifier, huge VP potential with green tags. |
| Cartel | S-tier amplifier with goat | Another resource amplifier. 5-7+ MC-prod with Earth tags. |
| Satellites | S-tier amplifier with goat | Strong with many space tags. "For nine MC I can get seven" production. |
| Miranda Resort | S-tier amplifier with goat | Jovian tag, cheap, great late game even as worst case. |
| Toll Station | S-tier amplifier with goat | "Literally the best card in the game in 5P." Play as LAST action of generation. |
| IO Mining Industries | Always keep early game | 2 ti-prod + 2 MC-prod. "Too good to pass up." Only Jovian amp to play early. |
| Viral Enhancers | Both plant amplifier AND VP monster | "Green tag equivalent of Jovian amplifier." Costs 9. Gives plants + animals on green/plant/microbe tags. |
| Luna Metropolis / Gyropolis | Very strong but expensive | "Won a bunch of games on the back of a god-like Gyropolis." |
| Business Network | Strong card draw | Earth tag, ongoing card selection. |
| Mass Converter | Strong with science tags | Enables Hi-Tech Lab (draw 6, keep 1) and Physics Complex. |
| Standard Technology | Really strong with colonies | "-3 on all colonies is just an incentive to buy all of them." Best early game use = colonies. Late game = cities/greeneries for 16-19 MC. |
| Space Elevator | Strong engine card | Perfect with Anti-Gravity. |
| Penguins | "Probably the best animal card" | Better than Fish with Ecology Experts because of play timing (Preludes before project cards). |
| Protected Habitats | Top pick when going greedy | Protects plants from asteroids, enables holding plants for greeneries. |
| Ecological Zone | Very good VP card | Green tag synergy, placement bonus matters. |
| Decomposers | Good VP accumulator | 1 VP per 3 microbes, but Ants is better (1 VP per 2). |
| Ants | Better than Decomposers for VP | 1 VP per 2 microbes. Always pump Ants over Decomposers when you have both. |
| Fish | Classic strong card | With Large Convoy = ~7 VP combo. |
| Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid | Juicy plant amplifier | "4 plant production" with 3+ plant tags. |
| Hackers | Strong in 2P, bad in 3P+ | 2 MC-prod steal. Take-that penalty in multiplayer. |

### B-Tier / Good Cards

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Immigrant City | Good with Tharsis, city synergy | 3 MC-prod per city with Tharsis. Cheap city. |
| Corporate Stronghold | Good city card | Works well with city synergy cards. |
| Advanced Alloys | Strong with titanium strategy | Ti worth 5 MC each with Phobolog. |
| Floater Technology | Better than Titanium Mine | Flexible -- early game = ti mine, late game = other floater combos. |
| Floating Habs | Best floater target | 1 VP per 2 floaters. Works with Hydrogen to Venus. |
| Stratopolis | Good floater card | 1 VP per 3 floaters + 2 VP base. |
| High-Tech Lab | Really good IF you have energy | Draw 6 keep 1 with 6+ energy. Needs Mass Converter or similar. |
| Physics Complex | Good VP but greedy | "4 points" in 2 gens. Needs 6 energy-prod. Play late. |
| CEO's Favorite Project | Good late-game combo piece | Play LAST generation. Combo with Physics Complex. |
| Birds | Late game VP + grief | "Guilty of being the bird person." 1 VP/animal, -2 plant-prod opponent. Play last gen. |
| Large Convoy | Classic late game | 7 VP with Fish/animal card. "Equivalent to a Jovian amplifier." |
| GHG Factories + Insulation | Combo = MC production | Convert heat-prod to MC-prod. |
| Imported Nitrogen | "Insane when I have a god game" | Discount synergy, multiple animal placements, Earth tag. |
| Land Claim | Clever play for blocking | Reserve city spots, deny opponent rebates. |
| Capital | Good 5 MC-prod + 3+ VP | Late game city with VP. |
| Noctis City | Keep for LAST generation | "The power of this card is not the MC-prod." Even in tempo, Anthracite says keep it for last gen. |
| Protected Valley | Second portal value | Access to middle of map. |
| Rover Construction | Fine, not amazing | +2 MC per city placed. |
| Nuclear Zone | "2 MC-prod and placement bonus" | Decent for engine as it gives 2 temperature. |
| Trees | Good late-game plant card | VP + plant tag. |
| Farming | Good with Ecology Experts | 2 MC-prod + 2 plant-prod + 2 VP. |
| Herbivores | Good VP long-term | Half VP per animal on greenery placement. Tricky timing. |

### C-Tier / Situational Cards

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Soletta | "Okay but not that good" | 5.4 MC per 1 heat-prod. "It's immigration shuttles territory." Only good with Helion combo or if you already have 1+ heat-prod to reach 8. |
| Immigration Shuttles | "Not a great card" | Slow to pay off (6+ gens). Okay when nothing better available. |
| GHG Producing Bacteria | "Not very good" on their own | Need Extreme Cold Fungus or similar to be worth it. |
| Regolith Eaters | "Not very good" on their own | Same as GHG Producing Bacteria. Slow microbe accumulation. |
| Mohole Area | Mediocre | "4 heat-prod for reasonable cost" but heat-prod underwhelming overall. |
| Micro Mills | "Not a good card" | "6 MC for 1 heat-prod -- never buy this." Only if exactly 7 heat-prod and need to reach 8. |
| Space Mirrors + Equatorial Magnetizer | "Not actually that good" combo | 20 MC for 1 TR/gen. With UNMI = "okay, not great." |
| Phobos Spacehaven | Trap card in opening hand | VP card, not engine. |
| House Printing | Trap card in opening hand | Same as Phobos Spacehaven. |
| Designed Microorganisms | Trap card potential | Science tag OK, but "don't get baited" by max requirement. |
| Aerobraked Ammonia Asteroid | "Way too expensive" for opening | Heat + plant-prod not worth the cost early. |
| Interstellar Colony Ship | "Bad in opening hand" | Pure VP, useless for engine. |
| Colonizer Training Camp | Cheap Jovian + 2 VP | Play when oxygen nearing 5%. "Last generation where I can play that." |
| Zeppelins | "Awkward" | 5% oxygen requirement limits timing. VP is nice but waiting hurts. |
| Worms | "Rarely get good value" | Need 3+ microbe tags for 2 plant-prod. Usually underwhelming. |
| Invention Contest | Good for greedy games | 2 MC for 3 card options. |
| Greenhouses | "Not a good indicator to play Insects" | Better to play last generation for max plants. |
| Tardigrades | "I hate Tardigrades so much" | Bad card, only play with Decomposers for marginal VP. |
| Search for Life | "Never actually hit this in my life" | Cheap science tag is the only reason to play. |
| Heat Trappers | Niche | Steal enemy heat-prod. Only in tempo denial strategy. |
| Black Polar Dust | "I hate this card, it's never good" | Water but at cost of MC-prod. |
| Windmills | Bad early | "Takes a long time before windmills makes any sense." |

### D/F-Tier / Bad Cards

| Card | Rating | Reasoning |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Underground Destinations | "Never look good" | Bad card. |
| Asteroid (Standard Project) | "Should only be played with clear purpose" | Overpaying by 6 MC. Only for bonuses, closing game, or unlocking temp requirements. |
| Air Scrapping (Standard Project) | "These two are worst standard projects" | Overpaying by 7 MC. |

## B. Combos (50 Combos from Episode 05 + others)

### City Combos

1. **Standard Technology + Tharsis** -> Build city standard project for 19 MC (instead of 25) + 2 MC-prod + placement bonus + VP. "Fine but nothing amazing."
2. **Immigrant City + Tharsis** -> 3 MC-prod per city built. "Really good opening." Don't need standard project, city cards even better.
3. **Standard Technology + Credicor** -> Build city for 18 MC, Greenery for 16 MC. "Late game really good."
4. **Standard Technology + Thorgate** -> Power plant standard project for 5 MC.
5. **Standard Technology + Thorgate + Power Infrastructure** -> 1 MC-prod for 5 MC via energy conversion. "Fun but not game-winning."

### Titanium/Steel Combos

6. **Advanced Alloys + Phobolog** -> Titanium worth 5 MC each. "If you go down this road..."
7. **Advanced Alloys + Phobolog + Mercurian Alloys + (Turmoil policy)** -> Titanium worth 7 MC each. "Stretch to make work but really strong."
8. **IO Mining Industries + Phobolog** -> Use starting 10 ti to pay for IO Mining (40+1 MC). "Really happy if you see this in opening hand." Effectively 10 MC-prod over the game.
9. **IO Mining Industries + Phobolog + Advanced Alloys** -> Even better version of above.

### Colony Combos

10. **Standard Technology + Poseidon** -> 3 MC discount on all colonies + 1 MC-prod per colony placed. "Best use of Standard Technology in early game."
11. **Ecology Research + Standard Technology + Poseidon** -> "I basically crushed everyone." Buy all colonies cheap, then slam Ecology Research.
12. **Polyphemos + Pluto Colony** -> Solve the 5 MC/card problem with free card draw from Pluto. "Even though cards are expensive, colonies solve a lot."
13. **Polyphemos + any colonies** -> Luna for MC, Ceres for steel, etc. Use colonies instead of expensive cards.

### Water/Plant Combos

14. **Arctic Algae + Lakefront Resorts** -> Get plants from oceans + MC-prod from oceans. Need other water-placing cards.
15. **Kelp Farming + Ecology Experts** -> "Completely worth it every time. No questions asked." 2 MC-prod + 4 plant-prod + 2 plants.
16. **Farming + Ecology Experts** -> Good alternative to Kelp Farming combo.

18. **Penguins + Ecology Experts** -> "Probably the best animal card" for this combo because of prelude timing.

### Science / Card Draw Combos

19. **Mars University + Olympus Conference** -> "Literally never had a bad game." Bad science tags become good because they trigger both.
20. **Mars University + Olympus Conference + Point Luna** -> "Approaching GODMODE territory."
21. **High-Tech Lab + Mass Converter** -> Draw 6 cards, keep 1 every generation. "Really strong."
22. **Physics Complex + Mass Converter** -> Physics Complex needs 6 energy; Mass Converter provides it + science tag synergy.

24. **Card Discount + Card Draw** -> "A really good combo." Any discount card + any card draw source.

### Viron Corporation Combos

25. **Viron + Orbital Cleanup** -> Double science-tag based MC income.
26. **Viron + Martian Rails** -> Double city-based MC income.
27. **Viron + AI Central** -> "Maybe one of the best combos. 4 cards/gen." Boneless got 280 in 11 gens with this.
28. **Viron + Fish/Penguins + Ecology Experts** -> 2 animals/gen. Debated combo -- math shows it's "okay, not broken." ~0.04% chance of drawing all three.

### Heat Combos

29. **Soletta + Helion** -> Heat as MC. "Okay, kind of nice."
30. **8 Heat-prod exactly** -> "Worth 8 MC-prod because 1 TR/gen." Equivalent value until temperature closes.
31. **Helion / Insulation / Caretaker Contract + high heat-prod** -> Solve the "heat is useless after temp closes" problem.

### Green Tag / Microbe Combos

32. **Ants + Enceladus Colony** -> "Your own personal Luna." Free microbes from colony -> VP via Ants.
33. **Venusian Insects + Enceladus Colony** -> Same strategy, microbes -> VP.
34. **Sulphur-Eating Bacteria + Enceladus Colony** -> Triple colony on Enceladus possible.
35. **Extreme Cold Fungus + Regolith Eaters** -> "1 free TR every generation." Worth ~8 MC-prod until temp closes.
36. **Extreme Cold Fungus + GHG Producing Bacteria** -> Same as above.
37. **Extreme Cold Fungus + Ants/Venusian Insects** -> 1 VP per generation. "Doesn't stop, keeps going until game over."

39. **Extreme Cold Fungus + Sulphur-Eating Bacteria** -> Good combo.
40. **Extreme Cold Fungus + Recyclon** -> "Really good" combo (per Board Game Geek thread).
41. **Fish + Large Convoy** -> "Classic for good reason." ~7 VP combo. Play when last water closing or last generation.
42. **Fish + Large Convoy + Miranda Colony** -> Even more animals.
43. **Meat Industries + animal combos** -> Convert animals to MC.

### Floater Combos

44. **Stratopolis + Forced Precipitation** -> 1 free TR/gen from Venus + overflow floaters on Stratopolis (1/3 VP each).
45. **Stratopolis + Floating Habs** -> 1.5 VP per generation (floaters on Habs = 1 VP per 2).
46. **Hydrogen to Venus + Floating Habs** -> "Late game lot of points." Half a Jovian Amplifier for 11 MC + discounts.
47. **Floater Technology + Aerial Mappers** -> 1 free card per generation. "Literally a sub-mission measurement."
48. **Floater Technology + Titan Shuttles** -> "Literally a titanium mine." But Floater Tech more flexible.
49. **Floater Technology + Local Shading** -> 1 free MC-prod per generation early game.

### Special Combos

50. **Merger + Double Down** -> Triple corporation! "Now canon, makes me excited."
51. **UNMI + Space Mirrors + Equatorial Magnetizer** -> 2 TR/gen for 10 MC/gen. "Okay, not great."
52. **Robotic Workforce + Medical Lab** -> "Magnificent." One of the best combos.
53. **Robotic Workforce + Gyropolis** -> "Magnificent." Massive MC-prod.
54. **Robotic Workforce + Strip Mine** -> "Not as good as you think." Still need 2 energy-prod. No oxygen from Robotic Workforce (not in brown box).
55. **Robotic Workforce + Mohole Area** -> 4 heat-prod for 9 MC. "Good deal if heat has purpose."

### GODMODE Formula (from Ep. 01, 16a, 16b)

56. **Money Income x Cards Per Generation = Efficiency Number** -> If > 1000, you've gone GODMODE. "You need both card draw and money income."
57. **Teractor + AI Central (gen 1) + Earth tag amplifiers (Miranda Resort, Cartel)** -> "One of the best opening hands ever." 168 pts in 3P/11 gens.
58. **Point Luna + Mars University + Earth Catapult + IO Mining Industries** -> 278 VP game. "Insane card draw + engine."

## C. Overrated & Underrated Cards

### Overrated Cards

| Card | Why Overrated |
|------|---------------|
| Soletta | "Someone told me it's the best card for opening hand -- I wholeheartedly disagree." 5.4 MC per heat-prod, 7 is awkward number. Only OK with combo. |
| Heat production in general | "My view on heat-prod is not good, pretty bleak." Some friends hold it in even lower regard. |
| Micro Mills | "Not a good card." 6 MC for 1 heat-prod, never buy it. |
| Designed Microorganisms | Trap card potential. "Don't get baited" by max requirement thinking it's OP. |
| Phobos Spacehaven | Trap card in opening hand. VP not engine. |
| House Printing | Trap card in opening hand. VP not engine. |
| Space Mirrors + Equatorial Magnetizer | "Not actually that good." 20 MC for setup, 1 TR/gen = "okay, not broken." |
| Viron Corporation | "In most cases not that good because you need one of the good combos." |
| GHG Producing Bacteria / Regolith Eaters | "I don't think these cards are very good" alone. Need combo pieces like Extreme Cold Fungus. |
| Three Cards tile on Elysium | "Gets heavily overvalued early on with people overinvesting." Bad portal, cards ~9 MC not 16. |
| Milestones (in 2P) | "Only 3% of your score if scoring 165+." Wait until opponent is 3 actions away. |
| Tardigrades | "I hate Tardigrades so much." |
| VP in early game | "Mindset should be: VP worth only 1 MC in gen 1." |

### Underrated Cards

| Card | Why Underrated |
|------|---------------|
| Plant production | "A whole lot better than heat-prod." Always good in every strategy. "Always have some greeneries on the map." |
| Indentured Workers | "Literally always keep in opening hand." -1 VP irrelevant early, 5+ MC value. |
| Standard Technology (with colonies) | "Maybe the best card for colonies expansion." 3 MC discount on 17 MC colonies is huge. |
| Luna colony | "Always solid." Effectively 3-4 MC-prod, beats many mediocre cards. |
| Toll Station (in 5P) | "Literally the best card in the game in 5P." |
| Resource amplifiers (Insects, Cartel, Satellites) | "Often more impactful than Jovian amplifiers." People don't picture how many VP they generate. |
| Viral Enhancers | Both plant amplifier AND "VP monster." "Green tag equivalent of Jovian amplifier." 9 MC. |
| Ecology Research (with colonies) | "Might seriously change my strategy." Game-warping with Poseidon. |
| Card draw cards (in 2P) | "Super good in 2P." Longer games = more value from cards. |
| Attack cards (in 2P) | "Almost all attack cards really effective in 2P." Damage 100% of opponents. |
| Cheap action cards | Red Ships, Virus etc. "Low floor, high ceiling." Stall value as bonus. |
| Noctis City (as last-gen play) | Even Anthracite says keep in opening hand for last generation. Power is city placement + VP, not MC-prod. |
| Ocean rebates (tile placement) | Top players value them extremely highly. "Deceptively powerful swings" in 2P -- double value. |
| Greenery standard project (late game) | 23 MC for ~3 VP next to city is "not bad in the late game." |

## D. Tile Placement Rules & Ocean Rebate Calculations

### Core Tile Placement Values

**Resource values used for calculation:**
- 1 plant = 2 MC
- 1 card = 3 MC (2 in tempo, 4 in ultra-greedy 2P)
- 1 steel = 2 MC
- 1 titanium = 3 MC
- 1 heat = 1 MC

### Elysium Map

**Best starting area:** Center of the map near the plants. "Definitely the best place to be."

**Center tiles (with max ocean rebates):**
- Multiple tiles worth 6-8 MC each
- Three 8-value tiles possible around the central lake when oceans placed
- "A lot of value to be collected in the middle"

**Three-cards tile (northeast):**
- Theoretical max with rebates: 13 MC
- **Realistic value: ~9 MC** (adjusted for bad portal, unlikely ocean placement)
- "Cards there get heavily overvalued early on"
- Bad portal -- hard to get back to middle of map
- Best claimed with special tile (Natural Preserve, Restricted Area, Nuclear Zone, Experimental Forest prelude)
- Parker (GoDz): "Don't put cities on the three cards. Not worth the investment generally."

**First oceans to place:** The two central oceans (each with 2 plants). Then the two flanking oceans (each with 1 plant).

**Best city spot:** Center of map, value 36 (max). Adjacent spots: 30 each.

**Tempo play pattern:** Oceans in center -> greeneries next to oceans -> ocean walk.

**Greedy play pattern:** Special tile on 3-cards spot -> middle area for cities -> fill map for VP.

### Tharsis Map (Base)

**Best starting area:** Middle of the map near the river. "The best place to be."

**Key tile (4-value with juicy neighbors):** The tile near the river that connects to future ocean rebates. "Could easily be worth 8."

**First three oceans:** Usually placed in and around the river area.

**Two-cards spot:** Greedy players grab immediately, but beware of bad portal.

**Best city placement:**
- #1: River area tile = 36 value (best on map)
- #2: Adjacent tiles = 28-32 value
- Early game city with no oceans: the tile near multiple plant spots

**Noctis City:** Keep for last generation even in tempo games. "Power is not the MC-prod."

### Hellas Map

**"Engine builder's dream"** -- hard to ocean walk, two separate ocean bodies, milestones/awards favor engine builders.

**Best starting areas:**
1. North -- all the plants (main area)
2. South -- polar explorer milestone + cheap ocean (6 MC less)

**First oceans:** Top-left pair, then greeneries next to them.

**Special tile (8 value):** The cheap ocean spot. "1 TR worth 8 + placement bonus worth ~6."

**Best city spots:**
- #1: Northern area = highest value
- #2: Adjacent northern tile (steel adjacency slightly worse than plant)
- Southern city near 2 cards = decent alternative

**Portal problem:** Building in south requires teleport to reach northern plants. Need Research Outpost or similar.

**Two ocean bodies:** Need teleport to reach second body. Left body better (more plants).

**The "Omega flower" pattern:** Greeneries surrounding all 7 ocean tiles -- "never happening but beautiful."

### Ocean Rebate Strategy

**Rebate values:**
- Tile adjacent to 1 ocean: +2 MC
- Tile adjacent to 2 oceans: +4 MC (or +2 MC + plants)
- Best rebate spots: 6-10 MC value

**"2x value in 2P games"** (Anthracite): "If you don't capture them, your opponent will. Deceptively powerful swings."

### How to Deny Enemy Rebates

1. **Cut them off from rebates** -- Place tiles between opponent and ocean rebate spots. "Tempo players get really frustrated."
2. **Steal their rebates** -- Plant greeneries around opponent's city. Even giving them VP is worth it. Example: "5 greeneries around his city = stole 32 MC of value vs gave 5 VP."
3. **Don't place oceans that help opponents** -- "If you do not intend to play the map, don't create best oceans in the middle."
4. **Focus on your own game + block with special tiles** -- Land Claim, special tiles to interrupt their empire.

### City Adjacency Rules

- Greeneries MUST be placed next to a tile you own (if possible)
- "Portal" = any tile you own that lets you reach the middle/good areas
- Bad portal = tile on edge of map, far from center
- Buying city standard project (25 MC) just for a portal is "very expensive, not worth it in early game"
- City next to 2 of your greeneries AND next to ocean = optimal pattern
- "Pattern where greeneries hit two of your cities" = maximum VP

### Greenery Placement Pattern (VP maximization)

- Each greenery next to city = 1 VP to that city owner
- Each greenery = 1 TR (oxygen) + 1 VP (tile)
- Best pattern: cities spaced so greeneries sit between them, each greenery adjacent to 2 cities
- Total per greenery next to 2 cities = 4 VP (1 greenery VP + 1 oxygen TR + 2 city adjacency)
- Total per greenery next to 1 city = 3 VP

### Aquifer Standard Project Analysis

- Cost: 18 MC, gives 1 TR (~8 MC) + placement bonus (~4-6 MC)
- Net value: -4 to -6 MC overpay
- **When worth it:** Unlocking card requirements (Kelp Farming, Penguins, Capital), water synergy (Neptune, Arctic Algae), closing game, epic placement bonus, first action -> second action next to it
- Der_Maister considers it "crucial SP for early game" for tempo
- Boneless: "Still not on board. Rather expensive."
- Hidden bonus: 2 actions -- place ocean first, then greenery/tile next to it for rebate

---

## E. General Strategic Principles

### Engine Building

- **"Money first, VP later"** -- Priority #1 in every game
- Engine cards should pay for themselves in **5 or fewer generations** (earlier = stricter)
- 1 TR = 1 VP + 1 MC-prod = ~8 MC throughout the game
- In gen 1: TR = ~7 MC, VP = ~1 MC, MC-prod = ~5 MC
- In last gen: TR = ~8 MC, VP = ~8 MC
- "Don't get black-holed" -- if you stay poor, you lose

### Heat Production

- 8 heat-prod exactly = 1 TR/gen = ~8 MC-prod (until temp closes, then worthless)
- Heat-prod value: ~4-5 MC per heat-prod
- "Heat production by itself is underwhelming but with a little help combo then it's actually good"
- Soletta: ~5.4 MC per heat-prod. "Not a big fan."
- Only good if: played early, trying to close game, have heat combo (Helion, Insulation, Caretaker Contract, Kelvinists party)

### Plant Production

- "A whole lot better than heat production"
- Sweet spot: mid-game. Don't get 1-2 plant-prod early (too slow, vulnerable to asteroids)
- 3+ plant-prod early = OK. 4+ = good (2 gens per greenery)
- "Plant production is great in literally every strategy"
- Last generation: plants = wild card, worth 0-23 MC depending on if it enables +1 greenery

### Card Strategy / GODMODE

- Money Income x Cards/Gen = Efficiency. If > 1000 = GODMODE
- "In 2P-3P, always aim for greedy card strategy"
- Best strategy for 200+ scores
- Every 200+ score is with the card strategy
- Need both money income AND card draw
- "Discount cards stack exponentially"

### Game Length

- 2P: 11-14 gens. 5P: 7-10 gens.
- Identify last parameter to close -> don't terraform it if you're greedy
- 15 gens = "both players just omega greedy having fun"
- Transition from engine to VP: ~4 gens before end
- Pure VP cards: last generation

### Milestones & Awards

- Milestones = 5 VP for 8 MC. More important in short games (5P)
- **Don't buy until opponent is 3 actions away from claiming**
- In 2P: "Wait until gen 5 or later." 15 VP milestones = only 3% of 165-point score
- In 5P: "Fight for them as soon as possible"
- Awards: dangerous to start early. Must be confident you'll win.
- First award (8 MC) is safer to start

### Action Economy

- **One action per turn** (unless you have a reason for two)
- More actions in a row = surprise milestones, bonus claims, control
- Last generation: EXTRA important to take one action at a time (slow play)
- "You shall not pass the last generation before your opponent if possible"

### Cards by Player Count

**Better in 2P:**
- Attack cards (damage 100% of opponents)
- Greedy cards (AI Central, Anti-Gravity, Interplanetary Trade)
- Card-draw cards

**Better in 5P:**
- Toll Station, Quantum Communications, Galilean Waystation
- City synergy cards (slightly)
- TR-giving cards (both MC + VP needed quickly)
