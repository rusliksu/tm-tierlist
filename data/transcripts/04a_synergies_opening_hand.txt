Welcome back to my strategy guide on terraforming 
Mars episode 4. today we're going to talk about   synergies and then we're also going to talk about 
a literal recipe of how to winning the game of   terraforming mars so here it is this is like a 
list of priorities if you will so this is what   I think you should be looking for at all stages 
of the games we got to talk about the opening   hand the early to mid game and the mid to late 
game and to be honest it's kind of impossible to   make this list here without talking about some 
of the stuff we talked about in the first three   episodes because Synergies is in terraforming 
mars is just such a huge entity so some of this   stuff actually most of this stuff we probably 
already talked about but there are also a lot   of new stuff in this video for instance Floater 
Synergy is a subject to have a lot to say about   and this is probably the only video where I'm 
gonna talk about floater synergy at all so if   nothing else just go to 12 look what I have to say 
about floater synergy and then proceed to the next   episode if you want that being said I still think 
this episode is actually pretty important because   I think it's very enlightening to realize exactly 
what stuff you should be keeping your eye out for   in the different parts of the game mainly the 
opening hand the early to mid game and the mid   to late game so when you get your opening hand you 
get 10 cards two corporations a couple preludes   this is what I thing you should be searching for 
so first of all we got money income and card draw   when I get my opening hand this is the first 
thing I look for which of these combination of   cards will give me the biggest engine possible 
throughout this episode if this is stuff we   only talked about in the previous episode I'm 
not gonna spend too much time repeating myself   today instead I'm just gonna write on the bottom 
of the screen here for example check out episode   one tip number one this is where we talked 
a lot about money income but basically it's   anything that helps you to build your engine so 
we got Mega Credit-production Steel-production   titanium production and when you have a little 
bit of this going on when you've climbed out   of the hole then you can look at stuff like plant 
production heat production and also we kinda have   to take into account the number of players so in 
two player games it's really important to get as   much Mega credit production as you can in five 
player games making credit production is still   important but in addition to that you can also 
build your engine just by getting a bunch of   TR and stuff like this and then we get card draw 
cards and like we talked about card draw and money   income is like the two different sides of the same 
coin you kind of need both in order to have a good   game once again we kind of talked a lot about 
card draw in the last episode but there's still   some important stuff here here I didn't mention 
so let's look at it when it comes to the opening   hand I think I would always keep these three cards 
here these three cards are just too good to pass   up and since we are talking about the opening hand 
I think I would keep most of the card-draw I see   a few scenarios and a few cards I might not keep 
but as a rule like when you're starting out the   game card-draw is really good because if you play 
it in the first generation it's gonna draw you a   lot of cards during the game so in the opening 
hand card draws really good you might not play   it in the first generation it's actually a little 
bit more important to just build your engine build   your mega credit production first but then right 
after you've done that you play your card-draw and   you're gonna get a lot of cards from this so I'll 
definitely keep most of the card-draw cards I see   in my opening hand when it comes to card draw it's 
actually easier to explain when not to go for card   draw so for example if we're not talking about the 
early game but if we instead of talking about the   late game instead then some card-draw cards might 
just be too expensive especially considering they   might only draw you like one to two cards so 
is it really worth to give like a lot of Mega   credits just to draw one card sometimes it is 
but mostly it's not for example if you look at   a card like inventor's Guild if we're looking 
at the last generation or the second to last   generation then you're paying nine Mega credits 
plus three for the card plus three for the action   that actually allows you to draw a card so this is 
15 Mega credits just to get one card if you play   this in the last generation so that's really not 
good it could be that you're really desperate and   you're like I need to top deck something amazing, 
a Jovian Amplifier or something to win this game   but as a rule you really don't want to pay 15 Mega 
credits just for one card so inventors guild if   you played earlier in the game in the early to mid 
game then it can actually be quite good because   then you can get a lot of cards for this to be 
honest I think this is one of the weaker card draw   cards in the set it's a bit expensive for what it 
gives you I think but it can still be worth it to   play the card because there is actually one giant 
redeeming factor of this card I wonder if you guys   can spot it it's really important so you need to 
pay attention now here it is all the inventors   in the picture are Jacob Fryxelius who is one of 
the guys who made the game and then the text says   when great minds meet new ideas are abound it's 
brilliant I'm kind of fanboying let's move on and   the second instance where you would not keep card 
draw is if you already have a lot of good cards   in your hand already for example if your hand is 
like stacked with like good quality a lot of high   impact cards why would you need more cards just 
play the cards you only have it's fine if your   economy is strong you can still pick up even more 
cards to be even more greedy if you don't have   resources to pay for all the new cards you're 
getting then maybe it's not worth it but I mean   if you already have the card-draw cards you kind 
of want to use it right and this kind of leads me   to the third one is all about how strong is your 
economy can you actually afford to pick up even   more card-draw cards because these cards doesn't 
really do anything for your engine they're just   here to give you cards and some of them are pretty 
expensive so ironically if your engine is bad then   sometimes it's actually hard to keep these card 
draw cards because it's kind of like a luxury you   cannot afford right now what I mean is sometimes 
I pick up a card like a Inventor's Guild and then   I plan to play this but then I'm like oh I also 
have to play my engine and then I have to play   these engine cards first because otherwise you're 
not really snowballing and then this card is just   stuck in your hand and you're never using it so 
to be honest it sometimes happens that I buy a   card like Inventor's Guild for three Mega credits 
and then I have it in my hand the entire game and   then in the last generation I end up selling 
it for one Mega credits and obviously this is   terrible so what it really comes down to is my 
economy strong enough to actually play all of   these card-draw cards or number four if you're 
all in on cities or the terraforming strategy   then sometimes well like I kind of don't even need 
this card draw card because I just rather want to   spend all my resources doing this one thing that 
I'm really good at this game so this hand here   for example this hand is so good that I'm not all 
right I'm gonna be all in on cities nothing else   matters I even made a mistake keeping IO mining 
Industries in this opening hand here I think but   definitely I don't keep Development Center because 
all my resources I just bought cities I want plant   production I don't even need cards at this point 
this hand is so good already so if you're really   all in on either cities or terraforming strategy 
then it's sometimes better for you to just go all   in in that direction and then you don't need so 
many cards and finally card-draw is even better in   two or three player games because these games tend 
to be longer in terms of generations so if you're   playing a two or three player game or if you have 
a feeling that this game is going to go long in   terms of generation then card-draw is really good 
because it's all about the card strategy in these   long games to and the second thing I look for 
in my opening hand is synergy and I know it's   a little bit redundant because this whole thing 
is about synergies but mainly I'm looking for   Colony Synergy discount Synergy and heat Synergy 
so let's talk about Colony Synergy first I think   this is really important because I really think 
almost all of the colony cards and also the colony   standard project build the colony for 17 so these 
are really good so if I just get a little bit of   support for example standard technology then 
I might be more inclined to keep fewer cards   in my opening hand because then I'm more like all 
right I'm just going to build a bunch of colonies   it also depends which colonies are out there but 
obviously all the colonies that gives you some   sort of engine to begin with that's what you're 
looking for in the early game and also Pluto so   in the first generation I'm definitely considering 
Ceres Luna or Pluto and also a little bit Triton   but Triton is kind of like a weird one because it 
doesn't actually give you an income of titanium   but the nice thing about Triton is like the colony 
is really cheap because it costs 17 and then you   get nine back because the placement bonus is three 
titanium so maybe you can use these three titanium   for something nice in the same generation and also 
if you are playing with Colonies getting three   energy production is really important you can 
do this on Callisto or Europa so here the colony   cards and like I mentioned I really think all of 
these cards are really good maybe except for the   two big ones here on the left but I think all of 
the other ones are solid it's not like a slam dunk   you don't automatically just keep all of these 
cards the moment you see them but every time I   see these cards on the right here I'm at the very 
least I'm gonna really considered all right should   I keep these cards should I play these cards and 
play a lot of colonies that is something I would   seriously consider when I see some of these cards 
here and like we've maybe mentioned before even   if you don't have any synergies for colonies you 
have nothing then I might still consider playing   one of the colonies especially Luna over playing 
a sub-optimal card in my opening hand so starting   hand it has to be good cards it has to be cards 
you want to play otherwise why not just build   the colony instead so if your choice is this 
for example building colony on Luna or playing   this card import of Advance ghg without having any 
synergies for it or anything then obviously Luna   wins I'm I'm sorry I use this slide before I'm 
I'm kind of biased I like the slide then we got   discount Synergy and a lot of these cards ever see 
them in my opening hand I'm really happy like if   see Earth office even if I don't have one single 
Earth tag in my entire hand except for Earth   office I would probably still keep this card 
because then during the game I'm gonna pick up   some Earth tags and worth noting in that case I'm 
not actually gonna play earth office in the first   generation I'm only gonna play this office just 
before I play another Earth attack this is like   the case with all of them and Earth catapult I 
think the only way I'm not keeping this in my   opening hand is if I'm all in them cities or all 
in on Terraforming and even then I might still   consider it at the very least but it could be the 
case that I just want to go all in the cities and   in that case I'm not gonna play Earth catapult and 
obviously if I do have optimal Aerobraking I would   be more inclined to keep some of the space events 
in my opening hand so what I'm trying to say is   you have to look for synergies in your opening 
hand you have to look at all right what are the   effects that's going to benefit some of the other 
cards which of these cards play nicely together   there are actually more discount effects than 
these cards here they're also the effects from   the corporation so here's an example of an opening 
hand I had in the game and the opening end is   pretty terrible but I have this Corporation this 
Chinese Corporation I don't have the confidence   to actually say this Corporation out loud but it's 
just an example of a corporation that gives me two   discount on all building tags so this opening hand 
here was not really that good but at least I had   three building tags so I would be more inclined 
to go for those right and worth noting this   opening hand didn't really have any money income 
that's only like a little bit in fuel Factory or   something so I just went with whatever I could get 
then we got heat Synergy and like I've mentioned   before I'm not that crazy about heat so why is 
this a priority in the opening hand the thing is   I think the heat cards by themselves are kind of 
weak but if you had some sort of heat Synergy some   sort of heat combo then it could be kind of good 
so like I mentioned if I have optimal Aerobrake   in my opening hand I might also be more inclined 
to keep some of the cheap space event cards that   also gives me heat or if you have melt works or 
helion Corporation or something like this then   definitely you keep your eye out for all the heat 
production you can get it's kind of good in that   case because if you get to this point where you 
can get one TR every generation then it's actually   like eight Mega credit production because one TR 
is kind of eight Mega credit it's kind of like the   same deal if you got extreme cold fungus together 
with regolith eaters or something then it's also   one TR every generation and that case you could 
also make the argument that it's kind of like   eight Mega credit production for a combo like this 
but it's a little bit worse because as soon as the   oxygen is maxed then this combo is completely 
useless and if you for example like this let's   be honest annoying person who just keeps pumping 
up the oxygen then it will stand to reason that   the oxygen is maybe the first parameter to close 
and in that case this combo could be completely   useless in the second half of the game the third 
thing I'm looking for in my opening hand are my   cards supporting some sort of strategy strategies 
here are the ones we talked about in the previous   episode but as we are talking about the opening 
hand here it doesn't make much sense to talk   about strategy 1 5 and 6 as these strategies are 
something you think about in the mid to late game   but I mean it could be the case that you have 
like two Jovian amplifiers in your opening hand   and obviously you're probably gonna consider going 
for jovians this game but even then I would argue   then what you're focusing on is strategy number 
three the card strategy because really the Jovian   and the green tag strategy those are extensions 
of the card strategy I think so in my opening   hand I'm really just thinking about strategy two 
three and four like the filthy dirty terraformer   or the card strategy of the city strategy do 
some of my cards in my hand really support one   of these strategies and then once again we have to 
take into account number of players this is going   to be a short game or a long game because for 
example the filthy dirty terraforming strategy   that only works if the game is gonna be short it 
doesn't work if it's long game and you might be   thinking well you're at the terraformer you can 
just make sure that the game ends fast but that's   just impossible in two player games you cannot end 
the game by yourself in two or three player games   depends on the other players so if I am looking 
for cards in my opening hand that supports the   terraforming strategy then it's probably because 
this is a four player game or a five player game   but in every game I play I probably look for 
cards that support the card strategy or the city   strategy and speaking of number of players this 
also matters a lot I think when talking about   the two corporations in my starting hand I think 
some people think I'm a little bit extreme when it   comes to this stuff but I really think it matters 
if you're in a two-player game or five play games   some corporations are just better for two player 
games and some corporations are better in 5 player   games so in two player games I'd say that Tharsis 
is like B tier and point Luna is absolutely S-tier   with a goat Point Luna is amazing in two-player 
games and in five player games Tharsis is all of a   sudden s-tier with a goat and Luna is like B-tier 
and another example that really hits this home for   me is like unmi this Corporation is so terrible 
in two player games but that's because Unmi   is all about the terraforming strategy and the 
terraforming strategy is kind of bad in two player   games right Unmi in two player games is maybe not 
as bad as I make it out to be because to be honest   like if you have like one free TR every generation 
then that's kinda nice but even then it's still   just it's a bad Corporation compared to a lot of 
the others so often what happens is you're kind   of like griefing your own game just so you can 
satisfy this condition you have to get a TR every   round and then you could get another TR for three 
Mega credits I don't think it's good so all things   considered Unmi in a two-play game I'm pretty sure 
that's garbage however only in a five player game   then it's all of a sudden an A-tier cooperation 
I think because in five player games is all about   the Terraforming strategy to be honest it's so 
much terraforming going on and the game could be   over in like six Generations or seven generations 
in that case it's great you can even use Unmi in a   5-player game to like ensure that the game doesn't 
go super long so even if people have a nice engine   going on you can still punish the people with the 
engine by closing the game super fast and this is   something you can do in five player games because 
when there are five players around the table the   games are just gonna be shorter so really what I'm 
saying is the terraforming strategy has a higher   chance of winning in five player games which also 
means that Unmi as a corporation has a high of   chance of being successful in five player games 
but even in a 5 player game I'm still not gonna   award Unmi a goat I just can't bring myself to do 
it I'm not even gonna give it an S-tier I think   it's an A-tier it's fine if I ever awarded a goat 
to Unmi then the goats themselves would Riot they   would Revolt they would rise up against me start a 
revolution and overthrow me throw me in prison and   then in the next morning they would execute me by 
burning me on the stake needless to say Unmi will   never be awarded a goat Unmi is really the only 
good in five play games maybe four player games   but that's pretty much it and then we got Vitor 
I put it over here because I thought alright what   collaboration really comes to mind when I think 
about the card strategy there are a couple of   them but one of them is definitely vitor and then 
I was like this is for sure good in 2-player games   and maybe it's not so good in five play games but 
it's not really like that I thought about it some   more I don't think Vitor is ever a bad Corporation 
not even in five player games maybe A-tier for two   player games is even a bit low I I definitely 
sure that some people will feel like this is an   S-tier Corporation in two player games I didn't 
think much of this Corporation at first but what   I've realized is when you're going for this card 
strategy and you are going to go GODMODE like   getting three Mega credits every time you pick a 
card with a VP on it that's like a big component   of how to go GODMODE so definitely a win more 
Corporation if you're going for vitor if you're   going for the car strategy and you're having 
success with it this Corporation is insane on the   other hand the early game with this cooperation 
is really not good like you don't really want to   play cards with the VP on it even in the early 
game so it's really a slow beginning it doesn't   come with any mega credit production or anything 
so it's a little bit like Point Luna in a sense   that if you're getting lucky then you're gonna 
demolish everyone and if you're getting unlucky if   you don't really have any early game if you never 
get the card strategy up and running you never go   GODMODE then what is this corporation really doing 
for you not much taking that into account I think   A-tier is reasonable even though I'm pretty sure 
that some people is going to give this an s-tier   I heard that on this terraformer mars website 
something people are actually really enjoying   this Corporation but getting back to the starting 
hand are there anything in my starting hand that   really supports the terraforming strategy and 
once again this is really better if it's a four   or five player game and like we talked about in 
the previous video Regolith Eaters, GHG producing   bacteria these are not really good cards by 
themselves they kind of do need like another   card that can really give them some microbes 
for these to be efficient so I'm not a big fan   of regolith and ghd producing bacteria but then 
again I'm not really a big fan of the terraforming   strategy in general so maybe that's what it is so 
you could decide to just start terraforming based   on your opening hand it's like if you don't have 
any engine this is what you have go for it so in   four or five player games this is a fine strategy 
in 2- or 3-player games this almost never works   only play this if you're absolutely desperate in 
2- or 3-player games so I say that but here on the   starting hand I showed you before I kind of went 
for the terraforming strategy even though it's a   three-player game but I kind of did this out of 
necessity than anything else I just didn't have   anything better and so in my starting hand are 
there any cards that support the card strategy   so for example if I have a lot of money income 
if I have a lot of card draw then I'm definitely   considering going for the card strategy so let 
me show you a couple of examples of really good   starting hands especially when it comes to the 
card strategy I talked a lot about this starting   hand in the previous video but basically the 
starting hand it's amazing why because I can   play AI Central in the first generation and I have 
a lot of Mega credit production as well so if you   have both engine and card draw then youre golden 
and AI Central in the first generation that's   amazing so here is literally the best starting 
hand you can have this is like me Theory crafting   and that's a little bit of user made content 
here so I promise I'll be brief I have a later   episode devoted to user made content but this 
is like we're talking about starting hands we're   talking about synergies just have to show you 
this so I'm just going to be really brief here   talk about why this is really good and in a second 
I'm also gonna substitute the user made cards with   normal cards in case you don't want to play with 
you so make content or in case you don't have user   made content but why is this starting hand so good 
this is like everything I talk about in the card   strategy we've got a million cards and we getting 
a fair bit amount of Mega credit production Mega   credits from other effects and stuff like this a 
while back I played a deck that was pretty close   to this one and it was insane I literally Drew all 
the cards and I have like 700 cards I drew all of   them then all of the cards on the discard pile I 
also Drew all of those so I drew maybe like 700   cards in that game and that was like a year ago 
and since then we gotten some new stuff we got   new partner merger some of the new preludes so 
kind of optimized this starting hand afterwards   so I haven't actually tried this deck but it it's 
completely insane I promise you anyway this user   made stuff we're going to talk about in episode 13 
but right now I'm just talking about the Synergy   here and the Synergy is like you imagine I have 
a ton of cards a ton of mega credit-production so   here's the player order I would play this deck in 
and the only downside of this deck is it draws too   many cards I'm I'm not kidding you're drawing 
the entire deck and then the game is not over   yet and then you have no more cards to draw so 
if you have less than 500 cards in your deck I   would actually recommend you take out Undersec 
and Copyleft because this Corporation this card   it just draws you too many cards and also worth 
noting copyleft also makes your opponent draw   some cards which is not what you want when you 
kind of want to draw everything so in this case   I will substitute those two with valley Trust and 
space relay and then the prelude I get from Valley   trust should be vital colony and then the vital 
Colony you actually put it on leavitt station so   you get four science tags and two Jovian tags is 
really cool but I should probably move on now to   be honest there's a lot of people that don't 
really like user made content it makes sense   because it's not really something that developers 
made it's not really balanced in the same way and   stuff like this so real quick just for those of 
you who don't want to play with or don't have user   made content you can actually just remove those 
and substitute them for something else and like   you can see there's actually not that much used 
to make content here so instead of these files   you could substitute it with something like this 
and interestingly you could actually go supply   drop with Advanced alloys because this gives you 
a lot of stuff to begin with so you can actually   play this entire hand a lot quicker viron is kind 
of cool you can use it with AI Central Hi-Tech   Lab orbital cleanup but I win with vitor because 
when I'm losing Dev Wright I feel like I was a bit   short on Mega Credits in this deck and Vitor just 
gives you a ton so here is the starting Deck with   only official cards so no more user Make content 
and the synergies here is all over the place so   you're going to draw a million cards you're going 
to get a million Mega credits you're gonna play a   million cards and you'll get like a million points 
this is like if God mode was a starting hand this   is what it would look like I'm gonna move on 
now I'm a nerd I'm sorry and just to throw in a   little fun challenge here I challenge everyone to 
Theory craft a better starting hand than this one   maybe you have more user made content that I'm 
not aware of or maybe you're just smarter than   me which is entirely plausible if you do a theory 
craft something nice write in in the comments and   I'll talk about it in the episode called feedback 
so in the starting hand maybe you have some cards   that support the city strategy so it could be 
these cards here and like we mentioned immigrant   City Martian rails Tharsis those are kind of 
the big three if you want to like build your   engine building cities especially if you want to 
go for the terrible City standard project for 25   if you're going to build this terrible standard 
project in the early game it's good later but   until the game is terrible so if you're gonna do 
that you definitely need a lot of City support so   I need like two out of three immigrant City 
Martian Rails Tharsis it could also be the   case that you just see a couple of these cards 
on your opening hand maybe one or two or three   and then you're like all right maybe I'm just 
gonna to build cities in the second half of the   game and then you're gonna build your engine 
with something else with cards most likely and   then in the mid game you're gonna get a lot of 
plant production and then the mid to late game   you're just gonna place a lot of cities with these 
city synergetic cards you have and then you've got   to plant a lot of greeneries around your cities 
also reasonable other City energetic cards could   be immigrant shuttles standard technology if you 
are going for the standard project at least could   also be greenhouses although greenhouses is better 
to pick up in the mid to late game because this is   really a late game card this card is so good in 
the last generation or something let's say there   are like eight cities on the map which is entirely 
reasonable since you're going for Cities so that's   probably going to be even more than greenhouses 
like at least one Greenery In the last generation   is pretty common to spend 23 Mega credits to get 
a Greenery down so if you can get this for six   plus three for the card so nine that's a really 
good deal if I am going for cities I might even   pick this card up in the early game just so I 
can play it in the last generation that's how   good this card is and like we mentioned if you are 
going for cities it's kind of nice to see what a   Dream City starting opening hand is and this 
is it this is like Kelp farming plus ecology   experts combo really nice and got a bunch of 
cities a bunch of plant production it's like   everything you want when you're going for cities 
except this hand is maybe missing immigrant City   or Martian rails but you know you can't get it 
all but the city synergy in this hand is so good   that I actually even regret going for IO mining 
Industries which is crazy and then number four   in my list of priorities of what stuff to go for 
in my starting hand we got milestones at least   planning which Milestones to aim for this game so 
it's worth noting that Milestones are pretty low   in my priorities in the opening hand I'm sure a 
lot of people don't agree with this I think a lot   of people look at a game of Terraforming Mars see 
the opening Hand alright which Milestones can I   go for Nothing Else Matters I only care about the 
Milestones I don't think this is a good approach   I think the stuff we talked about so far is even 
more important than milestones and then Milestones   is kind of nice if you can get a milestone that's 
on your road anyway or if you have to take a   little detour to get a milestone it's also fine 
but just don't go all in on Milestones like if you   see the Mayor Milestone I got Phobos space Haven 
and early settlement and then I can buy a city   this is such a bad play you just instantly gonna 
lose the game just so you could get the mayor   Milestone it's not that important to be honest so 
in the the early-game and also in the opening hand   you should definitely have milestones in the back 
of your head like maybe some cards are supporting   a milestone somehow and you can get like an idea 
of what you might want to go for this game and in   any game you should always aim to get at least one 
Milestone but on the other hand in your opening   hand it's not really that important because one 
of the other guy is Tharsis then you're like oh   poop I kept Cities just so I can get the mayor 
Milestone but this guy is Tharsis so I'm probably   gonna lose that anyway because in your opening 
hand you have no idea what your opponents are   actually gonna go for this game you haven't even 
seen their corporations at this point so even if   you're keeping like a lot of cards because I want 
to get this or that Milestone then you're not even   sure you're gonna get it because you don't know 
what your opponents are doing it and once again   we have to take into account the number of players 
because in two or three play games the Milestones   are less important but in four or five play games 
the Milestones are really important then the five   player games I might be more inclined to pick 
sub-optimal cards in my opening hand just because   it's supporting a milestone and after I've worked 
through all of this the first four priorities   on this list so then I get to number five can I 
afford keeping some of the good cards in my and   for later the cards that I'm not gonna play yet 
but later on they're gonna be really good can I   actually afford to keep these and the reason this 
is like the last one on the list is because I want   to look at the first four points here first and 
after I've made a plan of what I want to do in   the first generation then I can actually calculate 
how much Mega credit is going to be left over so   can I afford to spend like three Mega credits on 
absolutely nothing right now just so I could keep   a card for later the two things you should know 
it's very expensive to keep a card that you're   not gonna play right now because three Mega 
credits in the first generation is a lot better   than three Mega credits in the last generation 
and secondly it's often worth it because some   cards are just so good in the mid to late game 
then it's worth keeping them in the early game   even in your opening hand sometimes so examples 
of cards I might want to keep in mind opening hand   well first of all definitely resource amplifies 
because we're still talking about the opening   hand so in the early to mid game this is when you 
want to play all of these resource amplifiers if   you can though it's pretty likely that I'm Gonna 
Keep some of these cards here maybe not stuff like   Zeppelins because of the five oxygen requirements 
maybe not Quantum Communications if I don't have   any science tags and you could go on but generally 
speaking I would be very happy to see these cards   and often I would keep these in my opening hand 
and especially the plant amplifiers if I have   some Synergy going on these could be really good 
as well to be honest it could also just be plant   production in General you don't really want to 
play this in first generation because like we   talked about you really want to get money income 
but you could still keep these cards and play them   in the mid game that's entirely reasonable Jovian 
amplifiers we definitely want to consider keeping   those and I gotta keep them every game but at 
least we're gonna consider keeping them the same   thing with the green VP amplifiers I think some of 
these cards are really underrated and they could   give a lot of points but obviously this is only 
if you're going for the Green Tag strategy some of   the juicy science cards like these ones could also 
be reasonable to keeping your opening hand even if   you don't quite fulfill the requirement yet so 
it's kind of like an estimation you have to make   how many science tags do I have in my hand and how 
long is it gonna take before I can get these down   and what if I never get the last science tag I 
need is gonna ruin my game you can also Gamble   and just like hope you get the science tags you 
needs it's a little bit risky because if you don't   get the science tag you're kind of stuck with 
a dead card that you play 3 for on your opening   hand and that's not good and once again number 
of players also matters here because generally   these cards are better in two or three player 
games because they tend to be longer in terms of   generation especially when we're talking about AI 
Central and the gravity technology amazing cards   in two player games but really risky cards in five 
player games so if you want to pick my brain about   what stuff I think about in the opening hand this 
is like the list of my priorities this is like   the list I have in the back of my head maybe 
subconsciously and I think a lot of you guys   have this list or something similar in your head 
subconsciously as well since we are talking about   the opening hand I would be remiss if I didn't 
mention some of the stuff we talked about in the   first episode indentured workers and Luna exports 
are really good cards in your opening hand lunar   export gives you 5 Mega credit production and 
indentured workers is also a great card in the   opening hand even though it gives you a negative 
VP because the way I look at it 5 mega credits   in the first generation like with accumulated 
interest for the entire game that is gonna be like   five victory points so it's gonna be way better 
than the one Victory point you stand to lose by   playing this card this card actually so good that 
I pick it up in the mid game as well I might even   pick it up in the late game so yeah I really like 
this card I think a lot of people disagrees but I   think this card is really good and of course 
Aerobraked Ammonia asteroid an Interstellar   Colony Ship terrible cards in your starting hand 
don't do it also keep in mind some of the Trap   cards the cards that kind of look good because it 
gives you a production but when you think about it   if you calculate how many generations before this 
card actually pays for itself then it's gonna be   not great it could be the case that you just have 
terrible cards in your starting hands so in that   case these can be like a good plan B a good plan 
C and to be honest design microorganisms this card   can actually be okay sometimes so now we've moved 
on to the early to mid game so what is exactly the   list of priorities of stuff I want to focus on 
in this part of the game so number six we got   resource amplifiers so once again the resource 
amplifiers can be really powerful and they can   straight up decide the game for you however these 
cards are still very situational they don't always   work so you still have to look at is this a 
good card for this particular game but generally   speaking I think a lot of these cards are really 
good but it depends on the game of course and it   should go without saying that if you have insects 
cartel satellites or something like this then you   should play to maximize the value of these cars 
by playing as many of these tags as possible   before playing the amplifier within reason and 
when I say within reason you probably don't   play terraforming Ganymede just so you can get one 
more Mega credit production from satellites in the   early game that's not a good idea and also keep in 
mind this aspect we talked about the production is   generally better the earlier you get it down so 
it's kind of a balancing act because the thing   is a lot of these gold amplifiers they're like 
increasing in value as the game goes on also I   should quickly mention robotic Workforce it can 
be really good together with Gyropolis or medical   lab and we talked about the strategies I'm looking 
for in my opening hand and stuff like this but if   I have robotic Workforce and gyropolis plus maybe 
I don't know two or three Venus or Earth tags this   is probably going to be my strategy I don't care 
about anything else this is probably just what I'm   doing this game and number seven finally deciding 
on a strategy the thing is even in your opening   hand you have an idea what you're going for but 
a lot of things can change during the game you   can pick up some synergies that just pulls you 
in another direction or you can see what your   opponents are doing this is going to be a long 
game or a short game so a lot of things can change   in the early game but now that we've reached the 
early to mid game you probably have a pretty good   idea of what your opponents is gonna do what your 
card is going to look like and you probably have   a pretty good idea what your strategy should be so 
I think this is a part of the game where I really   decide which strategy I'm going to go for and as 
an extension of number seven we go to number eight   should I aim for a short game or a long game this 
is also the part of the game where I think about   this stuff like we talked about on episode one 
if you got the greedy cards the greedy engine   you want the long game and if your opponent's got 
the cards and the greedy engine you want a short   game then you want to close the game to actually 
punish the greedy guy and number nine we got   the milestones and now I'm talking about actually 
buying the Milestones before we were like planning   on which Milestones to go for but now we reached 
the early to mid game this is the time where we're   actually trying to buy some of them so once again 
here the Milestones from the base game which is   Tharsis and also hellas and Elysium so I know I 
tend to talk down Milestones a little bit I don't   think it should dictate how you play your game but 
that being said it is of course quite nice to get   5 victory points for eight Mega credits so in the 
early to mid game this is definitely something you   should think about and technically since the first 
award also only cost 8 Mega credit you can also   consider this but to be clear it's only the first 
award for 8 Mega credits and even then you have to   be really sure that you're actually gonna win it 
because starting an award especially in the early   it's a mid game and then one of your opponents 
is gonna beat you in that award that's really bad   that's like game losingly bad and number 10 which 
is the final priority in the early to mid game if   your economy can handle it you should really start 
picking up VP amplifiers but I'm saying pick up   you shouldn't really play them yet you should 
play them at the right time which is usually   either the mid game or the late game for example 
if we're talking about the Jovian amplifiers like   9 out of 10 games you play these in the very last 
generation but that doesn't mean you can't pick up   the cards now the green tag amplifiers if you're 
going for green tag synergy in general these cards   can also be really good to pick up and then you 
play them around the mid game I would say except   of course for important nitrogen large Convoy 
and advanced ecosystems once again these cards   are probably best to play in the last generation 
or at least in the late game then we arrive at the   mid to late game so first of all plant production 
and I kind of feel bad for putting it here in the   mid to late game because truth be told plant 
production in the late game is often not worth   it the mid game is really when you want to play 
playing production cards or at the very least   after you've built a money engine then you can 
even play plant production in the early game in   the mid game is also probably also when you get 
to play some of these plant amplifiers they can   be really strong and although I did say the plant 
production in the late game is often not worth it   because it's just too expensive for what it gives 
you for the last couple of generations naturally   if we're talking about these babies it's different 
because these cards are so good especially   considering that these cards come with VP attached 
to them and the reason why plant production is so   good in the midgame and Greenery is generally 
good in the late game is because they give you   a lot of VP it gives you one VP for the greenery 
one VP for the oxygen and one VP next to your city   could even give more if this next to two of your 
cities so with plant production out of the way and   plant production is really a mid game thing to 
be honest then you can see the theme about the   mid to late game is getting the synergies that 
gives you a lot of points so Floater synergy   green tag synergy Awards and the Jovian amplifiers 
and other cards that just straight up gives you VP   this is like the stuff you want to look at in 
the second half of the game this is where I can   score a lot of points so let's talk about floaters 
floaters is only if you're playing with the Venus   expansion but at this point I'm kind of assuming 
that you are if you're not then skip this chapter   of course Floater synergy it can generate a lot 
of VP I think some people are underestimating how   many points you can actually get from floaters 
it's quite insane and because I feel like most   of the Floater cards are here to actually give you 
a lot of VP this is why we're focusing on this in   the mid to late game except for a few cards there 
are actually a few floater cards that are better   suited for the early game so let's look at them so 
here are the Floater cards that are pretty good in   the early game and to be honest at this point you 
probably know why this is the stuff that gives you   some sort of card draw or mega credit production 
or engine and then you might be thinking what   about Titan floating Launchpad and what about 
Atmo-collectors why are these good in the early   game but these are cards from the colonies 
expansion so if you're playing with these cars   you are playing with colonies and like we have 
established by now it's really good to be able to   trade so if you're having one of these two cards 
in the opening hand then you probably don't even   need to get 3 energy production and that could be 
really good it can save you a lot of gold and then   of course there are a few of the other cards here 
that could be situationally good in the early game   as well like Jupitor floating station if you have 
like three science cards and a bunch of Jovians   but probably you don't have that in the early 
game so this is probably better in the mid game   to be honest and then Saturn surfing is also good 
in the early game if you have a lot of Earth tags   this is one that's probably more realistic it's 
more realistic you have a bunch of Earth tags than   you have science or jovians because Earth tags 
are more related to Mega credit production and   stuff like this so it would make sense that you 
have some Earth tags in the early game especially   if you got lucky and you got like aquired company 
or some of these Earth Tag gold production cards   something like this but with that out of the way 
I think a lot of these cards are more suited to   generating you a lot of VP or TR or something you 
can use in the mid to late game I think a pretty   clear and a pretty powerful way to get VPS off of 
floaters would be to pick up like Jovian Lanterns   or floating habs these two cards are really 
good and the reason they are good of course   is that if you put floaters on this card you get 
like half a point per floaters and you can put a   lot of floaters during the game Stratopolis is a 
little bit worse in this regard because it only   gives you one third of a point per floater however 
Stratopolis has a lot of other uses as well it's   really powerful in some combos we're gonna get to 
that in a second and also notably stratopolis can   put two floaters on the card so if you put it on 
itself that alone is like two thirds of a point   every generation and here's a fun little stat that 
I noticed after I made this slide look there are   nine Jovian tags on the floaters that's exactly 
the same amount as there are Venus tags so this   once again underlines the point that I'm trying 
to make that with all these Jovian tags and stuff   like this these are really cards that are better 
suited for the mid to late game a lot of them I   think so here's the most interesting stat about 
these cards and the whole reason I think Jovian   lanterns and floating has such good cards look 
at this 16 of these cards has the ability to   put floaters on a different card and you might 
be thinking but they're only 15 arrows here but   that's because there's also airliners I just I 
I gotta be honest I couldn't fit it on my slide   so here it is but if we're being perfectly honest 
who the hell cares about airliners but the point   here is really there's so many cards that can 
actually just boost your Jovian Lantern or your   floating habs so it can give you a lot of points 
if you have some of these combinations here then   we also got a couple of corporations that can 
give you floaters and we also have titan a colony   that can give you floaters so I thought a lot 
about this and I boiled it down to the five most   important things you can do with floaters first 
of all we talked about this you look for Jovian   lanterns a floating habs and then you just Spam 
floaters on these cards like an absolute Maniac   this could generate you like a lot of points it's 
really powerful and secondly you can look for   floater combo there are actually quite a lot of 
these here's some examples for example we talked   about Stratopolis this is a really good card in 
conjunction with something like forced precipation   for instance so it's a bit similar to the microbe 
combo I showed you earlier in this video the idea   is you can get one free TR every generation and 
like we talked about as long as there are Venus   to be had this is kind of like eight Mega critic 
production that's worth and the reason I write   that this is like sort of worth 10 mega creative 
production is because that's open is the card   itself also comes with two Mega Credit Production 
once again this can generate like a lot of points   this is exactly 1.5 VP per generation because 
Stratopolis is going to give you like one point   and then the card itself is also capable of giving 
you like half a point every generation then you   might be thinking well it's actually cost two Mega 
credit but two Mega credit every generation that's   actually the same as a two Mega credit production 
you get from Stratopolis so it works out and here   is one of the sickest late game combos you can 
get with floaters so here we've got hydrogen to   Venus and floating Habs so this you typically also 
want to play in the last generation or maybe just   before the Venus closes or something like this 
hydrogen to Venus is actually so cheap that you   can also use it in a different way you can use 
it earlier to just get one Venus so you can play   something like venusian animals or something 
but generally speaking I really want to save   this card for the last generation because together 
with something like floating Habs it can generate   a lot of points if you think about this card is 
like half a Jovian amplifier when you use it on   something like floating habs because all of the 
floaters are like worth half a point per floater   so this is really good especially considering how 
cheap it is because this also has a space and an   event Tag so chances are that when we are talking 
about the last generation you do has a discount   especially on Space tags there's a lot of discount 
on space tags and of course the downside of this   card is what if you don't get floating heads or 
Jovian lanterns or Stratopolis then the card is   of course not good so these are some of the really 
good combo some of the combos that can really win   you the game but you don't really have to get all 
the really good combos there's a lot of like small   combos that are just fine that is good enough 
an example could be this one floater technology   plus aerial mappers so when you think about it 
this is just one free card every generation it's   fine it's actually exactly the same as sub cross 
measurements and the funny thing is the cost is   also almost the same so it's not fantastic but 
it's not bad either it's okay and maybe you get   some discount or maybe you can use the science tag 
for something who knows could also be something   simple like Floater technology with Titan shuttles 
so basically you're pumping floaters on this card   so every Floater is like worth one titanium so 
if you think about it then floating technology is   basically one titanium production once again it's 
not amazing but it's something it's not bad now   number three you aim to get the hoverlord and the 
venuphile this is like one of the biggest thing   you can do with Venus tags and floaters in general 
the thing is if you play it like they originally   intended then every game is gonna have hoverlord 
and venuphile so hoverlord is a milestone which   you can claim by getting seven floaters and the 
venuphile is the award for most Venus tags makes   sense that you have a lot of Venus tags if you're 
going for floaters you might not necessarily but   it would make a lot of sense if you have and 
number four you can also play some of the really   powerful cards with Venus requirement and I say 
that it's a few good cards which is true but the   biggest one by far is venusian animals and as 
you can no doubt see from these pictures here I   really like venusian animals this is like such a 
good card it can give you so much points so just   having an animal card with animals being worth 
one Victory Point per animal that by itself is   worth something and then like I mentioned in the 
previous episode what you can do is you can have   this card in your hand for a very long time 
until the Venus is finally up there or you can   even keep it on your hand even longer and then 
in the last generation or at least in the late   game or something you can just slam down Venus 
animal and slam down all the science tags you've   been holding in your hand just so you can get 
that extra 1vp per Science tag 1 VP per Science   Tag makes a lot of science tags insanely good 
and finally the last thing I want to make clear   about floaters is that most of these cards are 
just good enough by themselves I mean you don't   even have to have a good combo for these cards to 
be worth it I don't think that all of these cards   as a whole is stronger than the colony cards 
I think the colony cards are stronger but that   being said a lot of these cards are just solid 
by themselves so I just wanted to mention this   just in case you're like all right we're talking 
about Floater Synergy it's only good if you get   like a combo or some Synergy a lot of these cards 
actually quite good by themselves they're not bad   not bad at all so these are the top five things 
to keep in mind when you're going for floaters I   could be forgetting something here but if I 
am I'm sure you'll write it in the comments   thank you and number 13 also in the mid to late 
game we are looking at Green Tag Synergy so once   again we talked a lot about this in the previous 
video in episode 3 part 2 but here are some of   the important things to keep in mind when we're 
talking about Green tags first of all if you're   going for green tags then meat Industries Topsoil 
contract and also if you're playing with turmoil   you can get GMO contract these cards are stupidly 
powerful this is like going GODMODE with Green   Tags it's really good I think green tags can of 
course generate a lot of points with microbes so   for example if you have ants or venusian insects 
then you could get some nice combo with extreme   cold fungus or this new card bactoviral research 
and also decomposers can give you a lot of points   as well and when it comes to animals you really 
want at least one card where the animals are worth   one Victory Point per animal and the reason is 
there is also a ton of cards in this game that   can give animals to another card like for example 
large Convoy or something and here is like the   best example I can give you of how green tags 
can actually generate so many points so we got   Advanced ecosystem it's worth three victory points 
you play this in the last generation however if   you also have viral enhancers decomposers and 
ecological Zone then all of a sudden this is   like five victory points instead of three and also 
you get three plants this is by the way also just   another reason why you play Advanced ecosystems 
in the last generation maybe you pick up Viral   enhancers and decomposer or ecological zones or 
something that makes this card better in the late   game because these green VP amplifiers is how 
you can generate a lot of points with the green   tag synergy like if I'm going for green tag I'm 
having a good game I'm going for the card strategy   I play a lot of green tags it feels like this is 
even stronger than jovians it feels like this is   actually generating more points than Jovian tags 
here is an example of a game where I got a lot of   points from Green tags and keep in mind this is on 
the mars app so this is only vanilla and Prelude   I don't even have a lot of the cards here and 
in the mid to late game at this point we should   definitely also think about the awards so here are 
the awards from the original map and worth noting   here that when I say that you should look at this 
stuff in the mid to late game specifically I'm   talking about the second and the third award that 
cost 14 Mega credits and 20 Mega credits to be   honest the first Funder that cost 8 Mega credits 
that one is probably already got in the mid game   but the one that costs 14 and the one that costs 
20 honestly these are not that important it's   okay if you just wait until the mid to late game 
before you go for these so the first award should   be claimed maybe in the early to mid game but to 
be honest only if you're really sure that you're   actually gonna win this award otherwise don't do 
it the second award that costs 14 maybe in the mid   game is reasonable and the last one that costs 20 
there's definitely a mid to late game thing don't   start this too early it's really not worth it and 
if someone else gets it fine they just spend 20   Mega credits to get five victory points it's not 
that big of a deal and maybe they won't even win   that award and even if they do win it then maybe 
you'll get a second place that's just been 20 Mega   credits to get three weeks three points over you 
it's not that important and finally the last thing   you do in a game of terraforming Mars is you want 
to score as many VP as humanly possible and then I   changed the text a little bit here because it used 
to say "and other VP cards" but then I realized   it's not even limited to cards you just have to 
look at all your available plays really basically   which plays gives you the most VP in the late game 
and then you just go for that play So examples of   this could be Jovian amplifiers these are great 
cards to play in the last generation except for   IO mining industries you usually want to play that 
a bit sooner but the other three Ganymede Colony   Water import from Europa terraforming Ganymede 
those are usually cards you want to play in the   very last generation could also be just normal 
cards that does nothing for you except give you   VP these cards you also want to save in your hand 
so you can play them in the very last generation   but that's pretty much it for this literal 
recipe for success or whatever you want to call   it basically all the synergies you want to look 
at at the different times of the game there's a   few other minor synergies we haven't talked about 
like water Synergy but to be honest that's only if   you've got Arctic algae or Lakefront Resorts and 
then I guess also the hidden water Synergy is if   you are building a lot if you're like going all 
in on cities or on greeneries or both then water   Synergy is a little bit better because you can 
set yourself up to get some nice placement bonuses   then I guess I haven't really talked about Science 
Tag Synergy enough but I think I'll save that for   episode 7 called what everything is worth because 
I kind of felt that this episode here should be   dedicated to this recipe to be honest science tags 
can be played in any phase of the game really you   could say the science tags are closely related 
to card-draw so it's really good in the early to   mid game or something like this but to be honest I 
mean there's so many different science texts that   they do a bunch of different things so you can't 
really say the science take a better in the early   game or the mid game or the late game it really 
just depends on which science tags we're talking   about I will quickly mention that there are a 
bunch of science synergies that you should really   keep your eye out for so for example we had this 
example before but like research got two science   tags so that's basically two cards and one Victory 
Point unless you have all of this stuff then it's   a lot better so if you got Olympus conference Mars 
University Venusian Animals animals then all of a   sudden just the card "Research" is worth three 
cards a rotation of two cards and three victory   points I think I made this wrong (in an earlier 
episode) so the only types of synergy that I can   think of that I didn't really mention much in 
this episode is like the tags themselves what is   the science tag worth what are the Earth tag worth 
and so on but just a quick couple of words Venus   tags is like science tags in my opinion it could 
be played in any phase of the game depending on   which Venus tags we're talking about Venus tags 
are also closely related to the Venus scale and   floaters and hoverlord and venuphile and some of 
the stuff we already talked about here Then we got   Jovian tags I've talked a lot about this in the 
last episode called strategies and then the Jovian   strategy but generally speaking Jovian tags should 
be played in the mid to late game except for the   cards that gives you money income but even then 
it's not always the case sometimes even though you   have IO mining Industries in your hand you kind of 
want to play it in the mid game because the cards   are so expensive so maybe you have better place 
available to you in the early game and also a card   like callisto penal mines yes it gives you three 
Mega credit production but it's so expensive so   it's actually a bad way to build your engine using 
this card hopefully you have some better way to   build your engine and then these kind of expensive 
Jovian tags even stuff like panel mines are   best played in the mid game Earth tags generally 
speaking should be played in the early to mid game   because Earth tags are really closely related to 
Mega Credit production usually so keep in mind I'm   not saying that all Earth tags should be playing 
in the early game and if you play them in the late   game it's bad I'm just really oversimplifying here 
like for example media archives is a card that's   really good in the mid to late game and this has 
an Earth tag and once again we'll talk about all   the tags and what they're worth and stuff like 
this in episode 7 and that's pretty much it for   this episode so thanks for watching as always 
if you have any suggestions anything I missed   any discussion you want to start with me I'm game 
just write it in the comments and I realize a lot   of this stuff in this episode I talked about in 
previous episodes but I'm kind of making these   lists of exactly what I want to think about in 
the different phases of the game so I kinda have   to include it anyway I hope you still had fun 
and maybe learn something or maybe not I dunno
