so actually what happens when you think about
it you baited me three times into doing something dumb and two out of three times I fell for
it because that's definitely what happened yeah hello welcome today we're gonna look
at a friendly game I played against GoDz or Parker Parker who's like as of when I played
this game he was like rank three or something so he's a really strong terraforming Mars
player so I definitely had the better cards in this game I feel like so I should have
won with like five or ten points or something and I gotta be honest I think the pressure
actually got to me a little bit in this game which is kind of embarrassing to admit because
I'm a grown man and just playing a friendly game and who cares but needless to say and
without spoiling anything because it's gonna be a really close game I played the last couple
of generations absolutely horrible and I know you're probably thinking well you just don't
want to admit that you're bad at the game and no no no I I have a lot to learn about
this game but normally I'm quite capable of actually planning out my generation or just
simply reading numbers on the screen I couldn't even read the numbers correctly but yeah it
was oh I was out of it that's all I'm saying but that's good because it meant it was a
good learning experience for me which means it's probably also got to be a good learning
experience for you so I'm just gonna roll the clip of me playing the entire game live
and then afterwards I'm gonna have a conversation with GoDz where we talked about all the mistakes
I made and then at the end of the video I'm gonna come back Boneless from the future and
then I'm gonna go through all the mistakes that I noticed that I made when I watched
this replay and then you know we can make it into a game watch this game see if you
can spot all the mistakes like I just did and maybe I'll find some mistakes that you
didn't find or you'll find some mistakes I didn't find so yeah let's look at the game
and see you by the end of the video so commercial District could make sense but then I would
have to to go for biofuels the biofuels or no I need
the Science Tag don't I I think I need the time tag I could take these two I think the
good players would probably take these two but um I'm a greedy boy I want the gold but I think this is correct now that I look
at it oh man so we do this this this this I mean it is still greedy right I can just
play this then if you think about it I would be 4 M€-production for 1 plant-production
but yeah [Music] I guess it's okay this one is to kill his heat production I think this is okay yeah should we do this we do this go for cards
full greed oh what am I talking about I have energy production
here holy hell ah screw this man I'm being greedy I'll do this then this this this this this this is a very great game it's a bonus greedy game
let's go all right [Music] so the ranking I I don't know yet it might
be a bit misleading because uh I'm still new to ranked but I'm definitely not at his level
so he's like 22-24 on this account I think he even has several others probably his main
account actually but his last time I checked it was like the second highest or the third
highest or something so the gods is really good a terraforming Mass actually which is
really funny to me because I only know Gods from playing DOTA and watching him he's like
one of the big casters he's been to lots of the ti which is the world championship of
DotA so that's where I went from so it's very funny to meet him here but uh I'm I'm just
gonna like disregard everything these guys taught me and I'm gonna just got a base play
Super greedy so it should be interesting so pretty standard some terraforming see what I get here the virus is actually huge you look illogical
concern as well okay so he's just going for a standard and
the game really fast game that's what's happening so I have 22 so I think I just play this since
I'm breeding but yes heat production which is lucky for me it is actually a little bit risky to be honest
but I'm playing on my opponent I guess because I know these guys are going pretty much so
I might as well just remove that yeah it looks good it looks good YOLO [Music] but do I want the plants do I want I guess
I could just put it here but then I'm once again playing their game this is playing my
game taking the card but playing their game is taking the plans but I don't know I think
I have to take plans here I think Lance is correct I'm not sure I'm
definitely restricting this area so it's not terrible so now I just have to keep track of his plans
I can virus him next German actually it seems really good to me and then I play business
Network so I think I might even have two attacks I
think I could even do this I mean I am YOLO let's go I might even take
Vesta Shipyard even though I know I shouldn't but oh [ __ ] I am actually I am seven systems
in that case I'll take whatever comes back here I think it's fine well I have to take this just so he doesn't
get it but noctis is also tempting oh no I should have taken the titanium first Jesus
now I have to take this but then he gets noctis but there's still one point for me so yeah I have to do it like this it's still okay I'm getting some engine I
could keep this just for the point but I don't think he's gonna ah so what is this one point two points with
this probably even more but can I forward it let's see 6 26 so I can play this for eight
one Mega credit production that's 18. I want to play this I want to play yeah that's basically
it I don't have much else to play actually you know I could actually play it just go
full YOLO it's not terrible uh I have to virus right yeah yeah for sure [Music] and then I play space hotels and I'll meet a group yeah all
right you don't want to end the game so this is a classic game what I'm used to playing
that I want to play the long game and he wants to close early that's definitely what it is
right now so let's see what I get worms is interesting but it I have two wildtex actually
it could give me like two plant production but is it too greedy to keep worms tough sure
tough call I think it might be too greedy I kind of want to uh 12 20 I can play these two if I don't pick
up worms so no I'm not gonna pick it up yeah he's doing the ocean rebates thingy now
he's setting up to convert next-gen I think it's hard to say I guess I'll just have to
see if I can get some plantain or something planet is very good for me I still need the
science text I need cop draw I need a lot of things also have to look at the milestones
so this looks interesting but I don't have steel production no way to get steel he doesn't
either take away cloud seeding I don't know it feels funny just to cloud
seating just to mess up his uh his seat production I don't hate it but it's not really a good
play to be perfectly honest I think cloud seeding will come back I think I'll take the
best card here uh there's no way he takes space elevator
like that's literally no way I think I'll do this the worst case scenario is it takes
is he takes this cloud seating but I don't think it's a it's a really good card so I
have eco I have the amplifier for plans so I'll take this The Logical tone and that looks
fine there's no way I take that I don't think of water myself either did I pick up no I
didn't pick up so this is it's a little bit desperate to be honest but
I mean I have very little else to do this generation I actually have nothing to do foreign I think I'll take it just because I have very
little little to do okay well the good news for me is it's not
very efficient what he's doing but it might still be winning I don't know so he could not imagine Lang claim I kind
of hate this card but I think it's good for this part here 17 gold I might as well just take it I think
it's okay mining area okay yeah so since I committed
to this trash I might as well play it who knows maybe I'll get a some card to bumpy
but it is not a good play um not crazy about this this card might as well play this Pros are telling me
that apparently heat production is good so could give me like one point doing the game I run into the hacker thingy the energy hacker
thingy but I think it's still worth the risk I still only have one science tank which is
annoying uh foreign would be what I usually would think
about getting in this position but it's also very inefficient but for my situation it makes
me do a conversion so it's not terrible actually this one I kind of want but I think this will
come back to me I think it's gonna take one of the others I'm guessing yeah everyone on the Discord hates hackers
so I kind of want to play it just for this reason [Music] but I think the cities I don't know this needy
is not that good either to be honest but it makes me convert at least when I convert I
can play my eco Zone which is annoying for him I think I'll just steal Thunder and I take
this because of the science tag I think yeah I think it's good enough [Music] I'm getting something it's not terrible
he's doing like all and terraforming I should have a lead here but I'm I'm not sure we keep to under farming I could just because
I have ecos ecological sign but if I keep this and this that 30 and then I want to convert
anything else I want to do this Jen not really to be honest [Music] I think this looks okay so I can't really burn his plants [Music]
I kind of want to just take two um plants maybe here even well I could check this actually
that'd be disgusting wouldn't it oh it could take its rebate here and just convert next
to him and make him be really sad about his life oh I like I like I like making God really
sad about his life that is actually cool but then again it's gonna be it's gonna be
like a three-point City I guess it's not bad to be honest you know what I'm gonna do it
I'm gonna do it I don't need it so three five seven oh [ __ ] I can't even
do math I don't have a conversion if I do this what the hell am I doing three fun five
to seven oh my God that sucks I guess I have to do this nah well I mean I could just to get a sign
attack but I really don't feel good about it [Music] nah I don't think I wanted it's not
that important I could just find here to be honest 32. uh foreign my whole reason for keeping this idios I thought
it was okay because it could convert but apparently simple math is beyond my capabilities I might still just take the city to be honest [Music] ah it's so terrible why don't I have one more
plant no no the issue is I don't even know how to get
one plant Valley Trust is cool that also changes my
plan a little bit now I think I have to build the city here I just hope he doesn't have
plantain I mean he has two cars to be honest you can really keep planted because of two
cards I don't believe so but I can't know for sure so he's probably gonna pass now I'm thinking
but I'm not sure you know what I have nothing else I might
as well no I should wait until I convert right I should really wait ah [Music] so I need something to give me two plans or maybe I just never play this I just don't
play it at all it's kind of funny he's like playing so many
standard projects kinda like it well that's a science thing nuke Zone is good
but there's no way I say no to this right nobody got any energy production so there's
some Duke Zone and the other two are dead cats happy horse is cool lava flows is cool I don't think I gave Happy Rose to ecoline
that seems dangerous and then this is these are dead cards it's like this probably it's okay thank you I have to get one award I have to
get Builder or planner but he got no cities I don't think he's getting Builder but I'm helping in terraform by giving him
this maybe it was not good so the issue is I have the same problem as
I had the last generation I have very little to do special designs could be cool but not really I don't think I want it so he's taking two actions I should take two
actions I think the the difference now is that I can
start the next Generation converting which is probably what I should be doing I guess
so I I know he has noctis right so I could I could just take this maybe foreign this game is not progressing as well as I
wanted to I gotta be honest he might actually he might beat me just for playing standard
projects I don't like this I have so bad cards I might stand up project
something would be okay I think City and standard project Greenery and then I can convert and maybe steal this
somehow I mean I have so much gold I have so little
to do hello works now um you know what let's go for it 24 23. I think this is okay because I can
convert immediately foreign [Music] ery I mean he's not gonna build my plans I
played virus already now he's got Gardener okay so he could see
that I was making a play for Gardner but I I think I'm also making a play for the uh
for the bonus to be honest I think that's more what I'm doing might as well take this one there's no reason
not to there should be a plant there uh I think I'll
do this then do this and then ecozone here is maybe actually good
yeah I think ecosome there makes a lot of sense
then I can so Builder I'm one-off Builder no actually
I have Builder okay yeah okay so Builder is the one whilst that I'm getting this game
that's good enough and there's no rush right he's gonna get this and nothing else there's
no rush shouldn't be Mangrove could be a thing oh actually this
is really good right I have to take this [Music] and I don't think they want catapult these
guys do not want and to be honest at this point I probably don't want it either but
this makes me convert it's really good a little bit of plantain as well but I think
I'll take this first and then I'll take mining's position on Mangrove oh yeah Central well definitely taking that he doesn't know that I I have this many science
tanks okay so I have one two three and yeah AI Central
is four so I have what I need for Quantum extractor as well even without search life
so think do this I want conversion can I get air central down this gen it's kind of rough
not if I convert [Music] maybe it's close to be honest [Music] Mangrove could be a bit greedy but I have herbivores I don't know I think I'm keeping too many cats so one two
three I can do a central next gen and now I steal each bonus here and then I have to
pick up the Milestone as well and then I can do air central Milestone next gen I think
that's okay to be honest [Music] so do I keep mangrove [Music] I really want to it is like three points for 12. I think it's
still worth it also so I'm gonna take since I'm considering I'm me I'm probably gonna
take the card here and then I do one conversion here because that's gonna mess up his uh water
thingy yeah I think that's good so take the cards here I'm gonna take three
plants and then I convert to get the bonus I'll take this spot here I think it's good
and that's the last piece of terraforming I'm gonna do until the game ends by the way
I'm just gonna never play herbivores never play my plans I'm gonna just play Olympus
conference yeah Central just go for the long game it's even questionable to help him end
the game like this but uh it is what it is well he's not gonna get the
last one surely he's not gonna get the last one I think I could wait a while I think actually
I should find some of this I should fund Banker right yeah I should find Banker so let's see I can draw first this is also
bushes I want to play Zeppelins no thank you now I have to I have to get this this and
this is enough so this is 31 plus four can I even get it though [Music] wait a minute uh this and this is 31. so I only need to
sell one card actually oh Leo it's a little bit risky because he's gonna start next gen
but I don't think he's gonna nah man he's not gonna take Builder from me there's no
way [Music] you know what I think that's good enough I have to I have to play a central when I
can right there's no way I don't have energy I'm such an idiot oh my
God oh the stupid City oh no I knew that was a
mistake in that case I shouldn't uh uh man that's so awkward in that case I should probably
play my plant tags and just get this uh one of these things I think scientist is safe
I think like Bankers safe right scientists should be super safe like he should have zero right I still have
one I guess one two three four I think I found scientists and then I just play some plant tags here [Music] thank you I could sell one card to get Legend down but
do I really want Legend in my position I'm not even sure play this card to be honest
if this goes to eight I lose if this goes to nine I lose Maybe I don't think I don't
think I want Legend I think I'll just play this maybe just pass
you could sell something I don't think passing is fine I think that is fine so I'm definitely winning
Builder it's just a matter of when I should pick it up more here production for him more ending the
game for him I think water is gonna end the game to be honest it's still five for water
I think definitely have to cut water cards what can you do you get something back on
events but this is still late it feels like I think water's the last one to end this is
not a big deal industrial center yeah who cares maybe I think I need the energy myself
let's take this but then I help him end which is not good at that Legend foreign so I think I have to take it because of the
energy production oh actually I complete this and play this right one two three four that
makes more sense [Music] another game where I play Early breathing filters feels good
I think that's what I have to do to be honest so I don't think I keep deep will hating that
also just helps him end the game Legend I don't I don't keep anything to be honest right
half a point here but I don't think it has much value yeah all right foreign I don't like this at all but at least he's not touching my milestones
and Banker should also be mine he has some gold I think he wants to it kind of feels like if I just play landlord
I win the game but I'm not sure landlord thermalist he could do a thermalist he could for sure do thermalists I think Banker makes sense Banker but I don't know I also have an expensive
plan here yeah I'm not sure I think I just play my cards
it's good enough [Music] one two three four LG okay and just down to
two cards again another chance this is mine this is mine I think at the start of the Next Generation
I'm gonna phone Banker but let's see what hey essential gives me
if I've if I have enough cash I might actually play Cows here also Thunder farming is a thing it's under
calming farming might be better than cows I'm not taking this bonus you can have it what I'm gonna do is bring fill this and oh telling your comment is cool and column extractor [Music] then I'm gonna
play air central that's pretty much it so he has to end the date if he doesn't end
the need I think I win [Music] but I don't think you can do it decomposers herbivores something like this
there's also this is I have some water cards if I want to go that way but it kind of feels
like I need to force him to close the game so you cannot take planner you cannot Builder we just have to get my well I cannot say no
to kill farming around I think that's too good to pass up even even for my grid and
then I hope endangered workers comes to me but I'm not sure large Convoy School that's a lot of points
actually is kind of cool but I don't think it's better
than this I think that's called voice just straight up better [Music] it's annoying so
many water cards here not happy to see that at all greenhouses is like one I don't know why I
kept that that was unnecessary but this is still worth it though I don't think so I think it's like half a
point and one plant right it's not enough to justify spending nine gold on this I think
this and this and I I try to play my hand and try to go for Gen 9 the Gen 10. I think
that's how I have to play yeah it's it's ah I don't know maybe even
this is too greedy but I kind of want to I mean it didn't play cow last gen so I'm
already playing car now I think it's still worth it I think I do cow but no greenhouses I have to play it now though so this generation
is pretty much cow killed farming draw a bunch of cards also have to fund and I maybe also have to pick up the Milestone
depending on what he does but I think this is correct it feels wrong man uh normally
I would take I would say greenhouses but in this game I don't think I can do it I think
I do this it's okay so may uh build a I mean yes how many cats four cards uh he's not taking
Builder from me he's not gonna take this from me either I don't think so I'll do this and unfortunately I don't have a comment [ __ ]
the correct play was to draw to see if I could get a comment but at the same time if I do
that then uh also I'm open to funding something so and I'm also
closing the game which I don't know what to do so I think he'll take the bonus that's
a little I can do about it he's not going to though at least not yet now the city kinda looks better maybe I should
have kept this city so now he's baiting me into taking the award
do I wondered kind of don't think I'd do I mean it is a
water oh my God I would hate not taking this water when he's offering it but I think it
is a bait I think he wants me to take it so I help him close the game but I think this
game should be over either way [Music] I think I'll just play you can post a skill
time something like this and then also the cow if I want to play the cow I have to play
it now how much is this livestock yikes 13. I have loan so livestock kelp farming alone
that seems good I think that's all I should do good enough I might not even play herbivores
this game it might just be be bad yeah this makes sense oh so this is actually a point for me right
I think this small thing is actually the point for me that's funny I think I'll just go a
little let's see what's happened so right now I have if I really want to play
livestock I have to sell three cards which is not cool alternatively I can I don't know I played Four he played Four this means nothing
I could even large Convoy just on some smaller animal I think if I don't play livestock now
I don't play it at all so I can just oh I don't like this but I think Guild farming is better than livestock
to be honest Guild farming Turtle farming symbolic fungus it's kind of like a point
if I'm not mistaking I have so many cards in my hand I want to play it's a bit greedy
what I'm doing I might not play my job units either I might though it's still five points
for this six points if I play the other one I don't think I'm playing livestock this game
maybe I'm saving it for next gen in case I have money but I don't think I have so I can
sell something I can sell like lichen just to clean up a little bit [Music] you're selling three cards everything just
so I can get I mean this is one point but getting the cows down now is also one point capital is only if my banker gets in trouble
[Music] right that's no I mean there's three points here but it doesn't really feel necessary is there any point in oh does this work with
this [Music] Jesus doesn't work with my it might media archives for evil no it's not
tag right forever event ever played no I don't think it works there's one girl to be had by playing media
aircrafts now but I can also wait and get three gold so do I play cows or do I just forget about
cows and just play the uh microbe the microbe might be what I should do oh okay
he's setting up to and text him yeah that makes sense but Kenny though that's a question [Music] [Music] [Music] I think we kinda even there's no way you're
still building text in hand I don't think so let's see how much this goes chaos is one
point if I play it now and then it is another three points let me just sell some water or
something and then it's like another three point so that's one and a half point I get
is it four it's actually Four oh man I think one of the cows now that'll look at it this
is like one point but it could also be one point next gen no we couldn't have to play
now ah the greedy way to do it but to be to play
this now and then because there's one here I don't
know it feels like it shouldn't be correct I could also just sell my towel at this point [Music] if I'm not playing this now I'm selling it
so I have to I have to choose between these two it's really rough I think livestock is
slightly better so Mangrove he's gonna get the last available
Tiana which sucks but you just want to live I think livestock is what I have to do here but do I even keep do we even play this for
four points is the other question maybe I don't don't play livestock or large Conway
six punch though and two cuts oh no I 
think I think I'll just play lifestyle it's good enough it's okay so I do this play livestock foreign [Music] scientists doesn't matter uh he has no tax underground city doesn't matter I think immigrant
City just for cheap City could make sense yeah that's the only thing that makes innocence
right now this I don't want to play against insects you can have I don't care I also like
one Greenway fan oh man so for sure it's gonna burn my plans if I
let him so three plants versus like like an entire Greenery oh my God but then also help
him end which I don't want ah these are not cards I want to see right
now [Music] insects is very good for me though to say
insects immigrant City and have a lot of points but [Music] I still have too much stuff in my hand I want
to play I have cards that gives me six points I don't think I'm keeping insects I think
he has to has to do it the question is also can he actually keep insects and also close
the game right now because he has to he has to close the game at night if you can't close
the game right now I win I think I win anyway but I'm not sure but if he doesn't in right now I'll win for
sure like no question foreign so do I want to play my amplifier that's like
4.5 points I think I don't play asteroid managers audio I might play large Convoy and the amplifier
but I don't know it really depends if he's going to end the game right now I think immigrant seat is correct in any case it's just too many points [Music] is it three
points for 16. I'm not entirely sure let's see if the game drags on he has to prove
that he can close the game right now so one two one two three one so that's he doesn't
have standard projects or anything so that's 23 and three times 40. so that's
42 and 23 huh 42 isn't it yeah 42 3 so that's 55. the
heating clothes actually [ __ ] it's it's definitely the last generation I just have
to figure out how to overtake any points which should not be too difficult I hope I need to play one more to get some points
here I need to play one more because of the no actually I have to decompose I need to
play one more for ecological time I need to look at my plants you should take the last two O2 bumps I don't
know what he's thinking about you should definitely take this and this like there's no question
I really don't know what he's thinking about oh he didn't ah he's baiting me he's beating
me again but I mean it's uh what the hell does he want to play like 23 see now theater 14 23 it's 55 he can close the game why is
he giving me this last conversion I really don't understand this that is so strange to me that must be a really
good card in his hand he wants to play I I know that he can close the game if he wants
to like for sure so I don't know I'm taking this I believe I'm the winning even if I take
this right because it's eight I think 
I am [Music] a flip bank or something now I think
I would straight up winning if I just get the last conversion so the last conversion
is interesting I can get it here and then I have just enough plans around Mercedes I
think that could make sense this also makes sense because of the plants I have right now I have
for a conversion of the extra round if I play Thunder farming in Casey burns my plants I
have a little bit extra I don't know man I think this is great immigrants it is just too good [Music] so I'm never playing herbivors by
the way that wasn't a mistake I am a little bit too greedy it would seem to me it feels like it really player is going
to win this in nine generations for the record but let's see if I'm correct these were standard
projects yeah I don't want to do this you can you can he can do that himself what do I want to do I think I just want to
chill and just throw some cards it's no rush doing anything [Music] it's 65.
he might actually be winning am I stupid foreign I'm getting tilted if he wins eight points
you can do one more [Music] 14. he cannot do one more so now he has to choose either
to close the game or I mean he has to just close the game that's no question just has
to so he's gonna be at 19 so he cannot make another Greenery so um I know that this is gonna be score right how to what the hell how did you get this
no oh [ __ ] I did not expect this how did he have this
much cash what did I miss 80 points [ __ ] I'm actually lost oh my
God that's  so bad all right let's see I should have started the last award Maybe no I couldn't I couldn't have oh man if I lose this it's such a throw so this is six points I think I have to play
this [Music] oh my God what I'm doing I'm actually I'm
actually tilting I'm playing so poorly right now yeah I threw this Jesus Christ I threw this heart uh maybe I'll win on gold actually I might
win on gold here all right so I'm definitely selling some cards now I'm selling this I
can still play my amplifier but I don't think it's enough Jesus Christ I might have just lost just by yeah of course I'm losing there's no way I'm
playing this holy hell what am I doing yeah I'm definitely lost Jesus I'm not sad that I lost but upset that I thought
I had this it's a little bit embarrassing definitely too greedy I cannot I cannot be
this greedy against these guys I have to be a little bit less greedy but I couldn't have found it actually I could
maybe I should have found a thermalist on one I'm not sure yikes yikes CX also might have given him this last award
by making the greenery so that's a swing of two but that's a swing of three oh my God what a terrible performance by me foreign this was winnable for sure [Music] just get too many cuts all right this was winnable I don't think my strategy
was wrong my execution was definitely wrong I think I think I should have won this for
sure hey okay yeah did you even very close uh I feel like I should have won this for
sure yeah I think you should definitely win this yeah um even the last venue I think you
made a huge mistake converting for one thing yeah I was I was wondering this a lot like
I was thinking well you're gonna convert you're gonna close the game but then uh yeah after
right after I converted I I immediately thought [ __ ] now I actually opened the possibility
of him starting a uh an award that's what you're wearing where are you doing it right
yeah I mean I had exact cash to finish so I was always exciting so I think your reasoning
is oh I'll take a green right away because you can end anyways yeah yeah I know by doing
that you saved me 21 cash so that 21 cash gets me landlord I think it's it's okay to
convert if you instantly funded an award but you I mean you didn't really have an award
like minor I think I was a head-on and thermalist I think you're ahead by one so maybe you could
find thermalists there I guess you can because you see I have no cards so I think you could
have funded thermalists and you just win yeah even if there's no award by you taking it
you let me SP a city which SP Greenery is like one okay I get the TR which is one point
well I guess I guess SB greenier is three points because I steal it I steal the TR plus
The Greener itself is one point so it's like a three-point play but a city if you if you
take it I can still SP city which is also three points so yeah I guess it's the spring
of two points but that would still be enough because if you don't SP Greenery you you take
the water instead so that's let's say that's the same cost so you get five points or the
or three points like you're saying I think you played nrb really early which I think
didn't score very well for you and which one uh the nitrogen Rich bacteria I think that
car was pretty weak to play early on yeah it gave me it gave me two points it could
have made it three points I had a card to to enable it by the end but I chose to do
something yes but it was either that or just do nothing with my gold I had a week a week
mid game there was nothing I could do yeah I think yeah I would lean more usually towards
just doing nothing and saving your cash yeah I think so it's a lot of money to get two
points for 14 for two points yeah it's not the most efficient it's not like terrible
like I mean it wasn't really 14 because you get I guess immediately yeah you probably
paid like you know 12 or 13 12 to 13 or even less yeah you get one money prod right away
so maybe it was only like eight or nine for two points but I had an amplifier for six
points so I don't know I somehow I somehow believed a lot of throughout the game that
it was gonna go to to yeah and I should be I should be okay I'm definitely winning if
it goes to 10 but I should be still okay if it goes to nine but I think I just I kept
too many cards I think playing AI felt incredibly weak it was gen 7 so you only got to use it
three times you play research coordination filters and Quantum is like a terrible card
to play you got like nothing from Quantum yeah I guess it maybe secures you it meant
I couldn't get serverless like theoretically you actually could have funded thermals because
of it but like like Quantum is just a terrible card to play there it's just like stick ing
13. it was weak but I have this uh when I see something greedy I was like oh man I have
I have to be greedy yeah but uh I even said it out loud in my stream it's like uh AI Central
probably yeah a little bit too late especially when you know I'm rushing like when you play
that's such a big cash investment to score like hardly any points unless you find like
the absolute like most insane cards yeah you're right you did I think it was Gen 5 or something
I mean I thought you was a free bump but because you had a conversion the next gen without
it you could have just oh if I don't know if I don't convert you have to convert right
which which so you're talking about the bump if I don't get the bomb you're getting the
bomb for sure in that generation yeah but I think that's okay like because I mean I
I don't think you care about the bump in that situation so much it was kind of like the
same way you don't care about me getting the ocean bump because you don't want to help
me end like I was like oh if you want to take this ocean take it yeah yeah I also call it
because at the end oh my God yeah at the end I was asking Greenery so you kind of just
helped me and by it so actually what happens when you think about it you paid it be three
times into doing something dumb and two out of three times I fell for it because that's
definitely what happened yeah because you had like the seven plants but you had one
prod so you could have I think what you should do there is just pass with seven plants and
you open with conversion and then ecozone me um yeah and then I don't care about bump
yeah yeah and then you just you just give me the I mean I had no I actually had like
no plants there like it would have cost me like I was asking during this because I had
the whole game I had like two or three plant prod until I got algae online I had no plant
prod yeah there's no way I I help you close the game I thought it was so early in the
game I had literally like fought a cash I couldn't spend on anything so I thought it
was okay to make this play to deny you a little bit as well but I don't think if I just wait
because then it goes to 10 and then I win for sure even just that last year and I think
if you I think converting was fine just needed to find oh I mean I guess you see I think
I also messed up by me I made a mistake because I sold my two cards and once I sold my two
cards I realized I should have um taken landlord right away I think I was worried about Saba
maybe and if you stabbed me that I couldn't speak asteroid but yeah um once I sold my
two cards I gave you another chance to fund thermalists and you know at that point you
know you're up plus one on thermalist and you can be like oh yes if I was a hidden thermalist
I completely uh yeah you're up one heat I had I think I had seven heat prod and you
had I had or six or seven heat product and you were had one because of your energy from
Quantum you were up plus one is to just do nothing there uh if if I like
okay so I could have just found it like forget all the math we were just talking about the
typewracks and everything it was just fun 10 minutes I went oh my God yeah exactly you
just fun thermal yeah exactly don't worry about the tiebreak abuse well that I think
that only happened because I messed up I shouldn't have sold my cards because I didn't need the
two cash the reason I sold them is because I thought I was going to SP City into asteroid
and I had exact cash for that but then I realized wait a second landlord's just better than
this since I have I had to calculate a bit first because I thought maybe you could find
landlord but then you were like you were too far behind yeah ah that was not good yeah
that was definitely a mistake for me though yeah which was a pretty big a pretty big mistake
if you saw that you had thermal aside I just lose yeah I was uh it was one of those games
where I had a lot of bad plays also made a lot of bad plays just because I felt like
I had nothing better but I think it's the wrong way so I made the city in the beginning
which was also questionable I should have made a mistake there I only kept the city
because I thought I could convert immediately but other than that in the the Dome one yeah
the dome for the expensive city that gives you three plants oh yeah yeah that seemed
okay to me because it was gonna you had ecozone so you wanted to get a conversion I think
it was a big maybe it cost you as well and you took asteroid over insects in the last
draft that didn't make sense to me I just didn't want you to get it right because you
were trying to end the game so you wanted to burn my plants and did you ever play insects
because I don't think I wanted to play n6 myself but did you play it okay I guess it's
a green review so it's two points because you had like six points yeah I had stupid
cards in my I had a German amplifier for six uh for six points so so I I wasn't looking
yeah anything else that's true if insects isn't good for you I mean I guess then that's
fine but I don't I guess I have Media Group so theoretically asteroid is the same as SP
asteroid okay yeah that makes sense actually um yeah I wasn't I don't even know if maybe
you could pay it off for me but um with Media Group I guess yeah cutting asteroid makes
sense and then if I have any other titanium cards I can use the titanium although like
I I knew I didn't even want to answer I mean I calculated my plan so I saw that if you
burn three of my plants I might not be able to convert so why why not cut the asteroid
I think I'm also gonna love about that one I'm bothered about the AI Central and uh what's
it called quality extractor yeah the AI I think was a massive [Laughter] I think the
SP Greener was a massive mistake as well as well I'd say those two like don't do either
of those and you probably win here yeah I mean if you don't do the SP or anything I
never end the game yeah Central stuff didn't affect me ending the game but and then yeah
the end stuff with the fund it was obviously I thought I had a great start and then I mean
gen 1 heat Trappers and Gen 2 virus gave you like with your Productions almost winning
all the game I was I was yeah I was sure is against the rush setup is like the best card
in the game like cripples me but the fact I could still end gen 9 I mean I had a chance
yeah I was like for half a second or third ah maybe I shouldn't what if it doesn't go
here production what am I talking about I'm playing against you guys you're always going
yeah yeah I mean sometimes you never know what they have what the hand is but that definitely
when I saw Eco lime with GHC factories I was like okay easy eco line yeah I was also not
sure about the my opening hand I I picked this preload um and then I picked this card
you just mentioned that burns your hip production they're going between me one energy to production
and I use that immediately to get down uh commercial District yeah commercial District
I wasn't sure about that play either but it felt like it was either that or just to pass
the first generation yeah I mean I was taking a few notes and that was one of the first
things I put was like commercial District seems a bit iffy but probably okay like you
had such high production um it meant I actually didn't want to buy not this city because yeah
excited I was also debating getting the card of the plants and I was like nah I have to
get the plans here and then yeah I was happy when I saw knock the city and I was like do
I pick this up and like nah I'll let you I'll let you suffer no no yeah it's just a useless
car I actually think it was I made a mistake I probably should have just I think I was
worried about passing I was never gonna play it but I didn't want to pass it to you um
I but then I passed you Birds instead but I guess you never played birds in the end I had a big decision playing cows or or the
one that gave me one one micro per turn that would give me like one points for four and
I choose to sell like three cards so I can play Cows just because I had the um but if
I had probably done the math maybe I should have realized I couldn't play both uh what's it called the big the big Comet from
your the large Convoy yeah yeah large Convoy I couldn't play both large Convoy and my amplifier
so I think I was debating whether to just sell cows and sell the large Convoy and then
just uh go for for my job in amplifier which was also six points so it's kind of the same
yeah actually I think I mean did you have I had two jovians and then I had two wildtex
and then I had the the one that gives based on how many tags I have right now you know
oh you had the terraforming Ganymede yesterday yeah yeah Five Points so technically it's
actually not as good as the the other one but then I didn't have to play Cows I don't
know man yeah anyway these are these are small things the biggest thing is like the missus
in the last generation that was yeah yeah I mean the biggest thing is yeah I think playing
how you played the last gen playing AI Central and then also the this shouldn't you should
be able to drag this to gen10 yeah took 302 bumps so that just gave me like that saved
me you know 70 cash right there so um like I I was not even close to being able to engine
9 without that like the Gen that I was just asking every Greener because I was like the
sooner I asked me this Greener I get one cash prize so I was like I'm gonna SP every Greenery
I can but you did good like cutting me off on rebates like you know the other that early
land claim I got it everything you did in the first couple days just like I'm gonna
lose this game yeah I thought so too I thought so too but apparently I'm still like I'm able
to throw on unusable games which is uh blocking me a little bit so good it was it was unranked so no punishment
oh I don't care man I just uh I get mad at myself for for making such mistakes but it
was very nice yeah it was fun so thanks for the game yeah you too thanks for the game
all right see you see ya hello I'm back let's look at everything I did wrong this game first
of all I started off this game a bit weird I went for a bunch of Mega credit production
which is not bad but I did play this commercial District right next to inductor City so I
don't think it's that bad it's just my style of play I I like having Mega credit production
but at the same time I think the tempo nerds would tell you that it's a little bit questionable
at the least because I'm paying one annual day production and a bunch of make credits
just to get four Mega credit production and I didn't have any steel to pay with this either
but looking at my hand I don't think it's that bad because I really didn't have that
many good plays to go for here and also later on he actually had the chance to get knocked
the city but he didn't want to go for it because I had commercial District right next to it
so there's that then I kept space hotels over where's the shipyard which is very questionable
given that I'm sets on systems so it's in terms of value it's like almost the same of
course the space hotels is better because it's four Mega credit production versus one
Mega credit production and one titanium production but at the same time I had one amplifier in
hand and there's one point on Vista Shipyard by itself so it is like two points out the
window it's I don't makes no sense to be aware of this you know what it is I think it's my
brain just realizing all right I have two Earth tags I can play Space hotels there's
only generation two this is amazing let's go and then I didn't stop to think about vestershire
would have been better for me and then also kept asteroid mine Consortium which is weird
because my opponent didn't have any titanium production so I know there's like again just
like where's the ship you have this like two points at the end of the game but it's rather
expensive I can find something else that's also two point by the end of the game which
is a card that doesn't have to drag my hand the entire game so I don't know it's ways
agree to keep this card just for the VP aspect of it because yes if I get more amplifiers
that's a world where I can give you even more points but at the same time as of right now
it will only give me two points so it's really not worth keeping so early it's it's not a
good idea now let's talk about Dome crater first of all I picked up this city which is
questionable and I knew this when I played it but it's it's like the same as commercial
District I didn't really have much to do and secondly I actually thought it would give
me a conversion so this is like the first sign that I I was literally turning off my
brain this game because I thought that two plants plus two plants plus three plants would
actually give me a conversion but no that's only seven plants which means that he's gonna
start the next Generation so maybe he can burn all of my seven plans and you know I
could have played the city one generation before but this is debatable once again because
I'm a little bit scared that he will burn my plants and so on so this is one of those
games that he just wants to close the game as soon as possible so if he gets away without
closing it like generation a to generation 9 then he's gonna have a good chance of winning
otherwise if it goes longer in 10th Generation so then I'm gonna win and normally I'm very
aware of these things but in this game I just didn't think about it for some reason so here
for example I just let him have nuclear Zone and lava flows I'm not sure he's gonna use
lava flows but he's definitely gonna use nucleus here he's probably gonna use both to be honest
so I should have caught both of these cards I don't know why I didn't and then there's
a small mistake here I played Heather before I played ecozone and this one I can understand
that I made this mistake because in the moment it felt like I needed this plan to actually
make a conversion because I need a conversion to get Eco Zone down but then what I ended
up doing is buying a standard Greenery for 23 so I might as well done that before and
then equal soon and then hither that would have been the correct sequencing but I mean
even then why do I even like pay this standard Greenery I'm just helping him to close the
game I don't know why I did it I did it because you know I wanted to take this bonus from
him and I think it's also because of something anthracite said to me just like a few days
before I played this game he said that well you can't just not terraform you have to go
for the bonuses you have to terraform a little bit because you have to get your points otherwise
you're just gonna fall too far behind but in this case I I don't know I should not have
helped him in the game because I have so much stuff going for me this game I'm winning the
long game so I I should have I should have not cared about this bonus to be honest it's
kind of a theme throughout this game a terraform way too much I should have not helped him
to close the game so yeah that's actually the biggest criticism of myself in this game
I I just didn't see the big picture but these are all pretty small mistakes I'm okay with
these but now we're getting to the good stuff let's talk about AI Central what the hell
so yeah Central and two player games generally good but in this case it was just way too
late it only gave me six cards and on top of that was just way too expensive because
I also had to play breathing filters and and Quantum extracted just to get this down so
this is like I know there's two points on breathing filters and one on air central so
it's pretty basically what do I spend like 40 gold just to get three victory points at
six cards I had a lot better use for my gold at this point I ended up having a German amplifier
in my hand for six points that I couldn't play because I spent all of my money doing
this like it makes no sense it's it's really bad so you know I played the whole game 3D
and I was about to think all right I'm gonna play Greedy and I'm gonna win and I almost
won by being greedy but in this case I I'll admit playing playing here central that was
a bit too greedy even for me it was not a good call and then we get to the last few
generations and I have way too much stuff in my hand it's like it's it's very bad how
I'm managing my resources like normally I'm planning out all right with those two generations
I can play this and this and this and then I have to sell these fine but in this case
I just kept buying cards I had no idea what I was doing it was it was really terrible
so I kept large Convoy and I don't know it's it's good right because I have like cows so
I could use it on birds or cows or something but so you know it is a lot of points but
I still have like way too much stuff in my hand already I've heard it was I'm not playing
I have a German amplifier I'm not playing for six points it makes no sense to invest
in such a big card now like like I have it really makes no sense to me there's even the
argument that I should have actually just caught ice cap melting instead of just keeping
this large Convoy or even if I keep the large canva isn't terrible I could just cut it I
could just like keep it in the draft and then not buy it because maybe he's gonna get it
but it's kind of rough right because both of these calves will help him to end the game
but the thing is ice cap melting is just so much cheaper than Dodge Carnival and yes he
will get five plants so maybe that's enough for him to get like a free green read down
or something to end the game but at the same time ice cap melting is just so cheap so I
think I should have cut that instead of large Convoy and at the very least it's gonna have
more problems closing the game with large Convoy so I don't know it's it's kind of rough
it's kind of rough so this is kind of what I mean when I said that I was really nervous
like normally I would just look at this hand and be like oh what are you doing you can't
even play all of this even when I was playing I I had this like illusion in my head that
I could play the Jovian amplifier and it didn't even I didn't even see that I was out of macro
it's like holy hell I'm kind of even happy that anthro said wasn't watching this game
because you know I could just I could just I could just feel his voice crawling through
me from across the Multiverse telling me Oh the misplaced oh the misplaced this uh yeah
I could feel in literally murdering me through the screen if he was watching this game um
it's good thing he wasn't watching this game but it's very bad that I have this huge hand
of good cards and I'm not like realizing the writing on the wall that there's no way I
can play all of this I'm not even trying to calculate it it's just completely went over
my head I think it was just nervous so for whatever reason I was just completely dropping
the ball here it even then the last generation here like I talked about with Gods I plenty
of chances to win all I have to do is to not make this last Greenery let him make it and
then he can't fund an award even better I could have just started the feminist or what
myself which I completely missed but you know we can talk about strategy but the fact of
the matter is I couldn't even read how many mega credits he had in the last generation
seriously I looked at his head I I just watched this and I think what happened dude I kept
scrolling through him and me and I thought my mega credits was his Mega credit so in
my head I was convinced all right well if you're close to the game he can't find an
award I don't have to think about the awards that that's literally what I thought and then
it made no sense to me when it then happened that he he like he was able to close the game
and thunder the water I was like huh did he just play alone how did he get this money
like I just really I literally just misread how many mega credits he had left like so
you know we can talk about strategy but basically I just lost my head there's nothing else to
it whatever so there's probably a few other small mistakes I didn't catch here but basically
the big mistakes like we talked about AR Central made no sense uh making all of this terraforming
when it's obvious he wants to close the game I was helping him to close the game way too
much that that's what caused in the game and then of course the big blender the last iteration
where I could have funded thermalist or at least just make him make the greenery so he
can't fund anything that's also really weird I didn't calculate that I think the thing
that bothers me the most is that I just didn't have any view of my hand any idea of what
I wanted to do with the cards in my hand like I had a German amplifier by the end I was
like oh [ __ ] I should probably play this Jovian amplifier and then oh I have zero gold
what what that didn't calculate but but when everything is said and done this was a very
enjoyable game it was very fun playing Gods he's a nice guy and I hope you learned something
as well because I sure did thanks for watching have a nice day
