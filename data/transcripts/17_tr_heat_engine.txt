Hello and welcome to episode 17 part 2. today 
we're gonna look at another game where I'm going   for terraforming so the two corporations I have 
here none of them actually screams terraforming   I have mining Guild and Teractor so none of these 
corporations are actually that good you could be   tempted to say that all right I have Mohole area 
I have Subterranean Reservoir maybe I could couple   this with the mining Guild cooperation and get a 
little bit of steel production and stuff you know   it's it's not terrible but it's not really good 
either I don't think I don't think that's really   what I want to do but the reason I go for Teractor 
is actually not that I have any Earth tags I don't   think I have any Earth tags but what I do have 
for Teractor is a lot of Mega credits to begin the   game with and I'm actually just going to use this 
to create effects to actually get a bunch of heat   production so my plan here is to play mohole area 
and asteroid mining in the first generation and   then I gotta play Soletta in the second generation 
so already I'm keeping a little bit too many cards   you could argue like I think it makes a lot of 
sense to keep the algae since um Arctic algae   since I'm really going for terraforming but it's 
not it's not really clear because I'm not really   gonna play the Arctic algae until Generation 3 
at the earliest because I have so many expensive   cards I want to play before this so it's a little 
bit greedy maybe to pick up the Subterranean   Reservoir and Arctic algae but that being said I 
think the start other than that I think is pretty   much I make the correct decision so right here 
the two preludes I'm getting is already going to   give him plus one heat production because I got 
the bonus and then I'm getting like four steel   and four titaniums I already spent the four steel 
to actually play mohole area and now I think the   correct choice is to play asteroid mining before 
I play Soletta right um because now I'm getting   two more uh titanium which I can then use to buy 
Soletta in the Next Generation look at this guy   by the way what the hell this green guy so he is 
Tharsis and he got already four cities on the map   which is cool that's of course not bad at all 
but then he also picked up the mayor and if   you've watched me talk about Terraforming Mars 
I would tell you that it's a giant mistake to to   pick up mayor in the first generation like he can 
wait maybe until generation four or five before   he has to pick up this Milestone even though he 
fulfilled the requirement it's way too early to   actually pick up a milestone he should have 
spent this eight Mega credits on engine and   then it should have picked up the mayor later 
on but yeah I'm choosing to pass the generation   with 10 mega credits here because I really want 
to spend this generation here playing soletta   so this is like a perfect example of just building 
your engine with straight up terraforming and Heat   so I talked a little bit about this and my 
strategy as well so I'm getting I'm not really   having a lot of the like engine all I get is like 
two titanium production and I still think it's   worth it to keep to to pick up these two titanium 
production just so I have a little bit of engine   but right here uh I'm kind of like I really 
want to play Soletta so I can't really keep so   many cards here so do I keep bushes do I keep 
Asteroid mining Consortium do I keep farming   I think it's a little bit greedy to 
pick up one more titanium production   and farming is a little far away 
I'm considering farming because uh   um because I know that I'm gonna be closing the 
heat so soon but I think bushes is a little bit   more of a safer choice also before we get any 
further I should uh apologize that for some   reason uh the Tharsis guy is also green I have 
no idea why it's a bug in the game so we have   two green players in this game so uh um right 
now is not a problem but once I start to build   stuff on the map it's gonna be kind of annoying 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna be like putting   putting I don't know my the Teractor symbol on 
top of whatever I'm building actually you know   what I'm gonna do something cooler I'm gonna 
put a face of Jacob Fryxelius on top of every   single thing I build this game so you can you you 
know when I'm building and when green is building   um I almost didn't want to show this replay just 
because it's kind of bugged but it's it seems like   it's really literally only the color that's bugged 
so if I make it clear which is actually my tiles   and which is actually the tiles of the Tharsis 
player I think it should be okay but it's a little   bit annoying there's still a lot of bugs going on 
in this game unfortunately so uh but we should get   back to the game so a lot of interesting choice 
here strip mine looks really interesting but uh   I I'm thinking well it's a little bit too maybe 
when I'm going for this really fast game maybe   the engine building is not that important for 
me and also I don't have two energy production   I think that's really what it is if I could keep 
right now both Luna Beam uh both energy production   card and the uh the strip mine I think that would 
be different I think that's something I would do   but as it is I don't think ah now I'm actually 
getting some energy production but I couldn't know   that right but there's a play where I should have 
went for the strip mine it's very hard to say but   right now instead I'm getting indentured workers 
and business contacts I don't think I really want   artificial photosynthesis do I? I don't think I 
have anything else that requires energy production   so you could make an argument to keep it just in 
case I would need the energy production but Tempo   is very important for me so I don't really 
want to keep too many bad cards in my hand   but I still want to keep even though that 
I'm playing a fast game I still want to keep   something like a Indentured Workers I just 
think it's very strong card so right now it   allows me to play Algae for let's say five cheaper 
because I paid three for the card and I'm a little   bit lucky nobody actually got any water yet so 
I'm lucky in the sense that my Algae is gonna   it's it's a perfect time to play the Algae but 
I'm a little bit unlucky because of course my   interest in this game is to close it as soon as 
possible so it's a little bit of a trade-off so   right now I think I can get enough heat so I 
can actually play my my plant production card which is definitely what I want to 
do at this point I want to close the   game as soon as possible it's a little bit 
annoying that nobody is actually terraformed   oxygen and water but you 
know it's it is what it is so right now uh you could make an argument that 
I could play the card draw the the business   whatever it's called where I can get the two out 
of four cards I could have ended this generation   playing that but there's also an argument what 
if I get a really expensive card or some other   cards that I rather want to play so it's always a 
little bit of a toss-up do I play the captain now   or do I play it in the Next Generation you know 
and I think the reason I didn't do it is because   I have this methane from Titan which is also quite 
an expensive card so definitely I'm looking at the   satellites right here and I think uh I I believe 
I did check my tags and I don't think it's enough   maybe I'm keeping it so nobody else can get it 
but I don't know is it is it if I want to end   the game at Generation 7 which is highly unlikely 
at this point but at least at generation eight   is it really good to pick up Satellites I don't 
think so but right here look at this this is just   the power of uh of Kelp farming right I keep Kelp 
farming with zero water being placed it is perhaps   a little bit greedy but I think my idea is well 
there's nobody else that's gonna have terraform   water and then I'm gonna do it so black polar 
dust it's uh you know it's it's not great it's   not that cost effective but it's it is a water 
and I do have kelp farming so maybe it's worth it   and I don't know livestock Lichen 
none of this looks very good to me   but um exactly kind of unlucky it's 
four bad cards I'm getting with this uh with this business research 
or whatever it's called so I think the most obvious play here 
would just be to play these this Jovian   uh that gives me it's so annoying 
two green players man what is this but I think the most obvious play 
would be to just play this uh   Methane from Titan oh poop there's 
no not two okay yeah I'm stupid   I can't play it yet because that's not two 
oxygen yeah in that case this makes sense   oh yeah and this Greenery is ugly right yeah I 
think this is uh because the rule issue has to   play a Greenery right next to your city (tile) 
and right now I don't have a city yet so that's   definitely a thing I I I'm looking at as 
soon as possible to get a city somewhere   but um this greenery looks ugly but I think it's 
correct to play it because I'm not really looking   I don't have a city-card in my hand so it's not 
like I can get a city in the Next Generation   and also my position around the table is really 
bad if I keep if I hold on to my plants because   now I'm I'm starting this generation so that 
means I'm gonna be the last player in the Next   Generation so there's a lot of a lot of turns 
where people can actually play asteroid and   and actually remove my plants so I think it's 
the still the correct call to just play this   really ugly Greenery next to an opponent 
City it's just I don't have a city myself so generation 5 definitely what I'm thinking 
about here is the bonus the water to get on the   on the temperature scale I haven't yeah I'm 
checking I'm checking tags right now I think   media archives is the only one that could be 
okay because I can play it for five and likely   I can get more than eight Mega credits back 
so yeah that's definitely what I'm looking at   I think it's okay investment loan looks good 
ecological Zone looks good ecological Zone would   be a little bit better if had more cards how many 
plant tags do I even have I have one and maybe   cows yeah I think in this case investment loan 
for zero that's probably the better way to do it hmm nitrogen-rich Asteroid I think I have 
enough plant tags mineral deposit is also   really good but when I can fulfill 
this card it's definitely better   especially considering that there's not a 
lot of oxygen and not a lot of greeneries   being placed yet so if I want to close the 
game as soon as possible then definitely I   need plant production so it makes a 
lot of sense Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid so the map is actually filling up a little bit 
quicker than I wanted to which is annoying so   I kind of need to get a city on the map pretty 
soon but the yeah I think what I'm doing here   is I'm actually just slow-playing a little bit 
because I really want to get this bonus on the   on the scale so I have enough actually right 
I have both the nitrogen-rich asteroid and I   have a 16 heat so I have enough to get 
the bonus I just don't want to get too   close to allow someone else to get the bonus 
so this is why I'm slow-playing a lot right now hmm so there's a lot of calculation actually 
can I can I play both Subterranean Reservoir and   nitrogen-rich asteroid I think yes but maybe I can 
all right I'm just selling a card it makes sense actually I think I've done the math since 
I'm selling a card like this I mean likely   this card is not going to be good but is this 
only to slow-play or did I actually do the math   I think it could be the case that I had done 
the math so what do I have right now I have 31   and I have eight titanium   and what do I want to play maybe I want to play 
both Methane from Titan and also I want to play nitrogen-rich asteroid not sure also I'll for sure get one more Greenery when 
I okay so now I'm I feel like I've slow played   enough some of the people have passed so now 
I'm pretty confident that I'm gonna get this one so now I'm finally pulling this trigger yeah 
and my opponent is is reacting immediately   by just all right all right there's 
nothing I can do about it you get this   but he was holding on to his heat just in case I 
was bad and and like set up the the temperature in   a way so he could just claim the bonus with 
only the eight heat he had but I think I I   slow played and I looked at my opponent enough 
that I was confident that I was gonna get this and this bonus here is really important 
and also now have enough greeneries   to get one more Greenery down I 
have enough plants I should say and I don't see a reason to hold my plans so maybe   I'm just thinking Hmm how to actually 
place this greenery right do I need hmm so I think this must be because I want to play um oh I should probably look at landlord 
actually landlord looks super good I don't really understand why I did it like this why do I not keep why do I not spend my oh 
it's because I don't have a city of course   it's so it's so confusing right because all all 
of the cities are actually belonging to Green the   other green so I'm like why why am I not spending 
my plants but it's because I don't have a city yet   so this play is a bit risky because now I'm 
definitely in danger of getting hit by a meteos   or deimos down or something but it also makes a 
lot of sense because I think in this generation   what I really want to do is to create a city so I 
can actually put the greeneries around this city   so it's risky but I think it's a with 
a it's a risk I have to take I think immigration shuttles is the same as the 
last game right it's a little bit greedy   but it's also very tempting because 
there's a lot of cities on the map but this is uh I don't know this 
generation I want to play a city   I want to play Kelp farming I want to 
play Methane from Titan sooner or later   I don't know immigration I think it's too 
expensive right yeah I'm not taking it   I think my plan is already straightforward I need 
two water I need my Kelp farming I need to build   a city especially so I can actually get rid of 
all of these plants in my hand so unfortunately   I haven't picked up a card that gives me a city 
like ever at all in this game which is unlucky   so I think I have to like spend the standard 
project but before I do that of course I want to   make sure that the I get the last available 
TR on the on the temperature scale that makes sense I actually I think I forgot to mention that I actually I 
balanced my heat production very nicely this game   I think I did it with this card I'm finally 
getting a city so do I want a little bit better   city to get VP or do a want to get it next to the 
water I think this is okay so this is the only   city I have it's very confusing but it's actually 
like this no but what I was saying is my my heat   production is actually very beautiful this game 
if you noticed I I think a few Generations back   I played this um the small heat production card 
because then I balanced it in a way so I would   always hit the 8 or 16 Mark so right now I'm 
at zero energy production Zero Energy Zero Heat   and now I can play insulation to just convert 
everything to Megacredit production it's very   pretty it's a I did a good job balancing 
the the heat production this game mm-hmm and I remember I did it intentionally I just been   talking about a bunch of other stuff so I 
forgot to mention it but I remember it was   one of the reasons I kept this uh heat 
production card a few Generations back normally you could say that this card gets 
better media archives the more we wait but   I don't have any more events myself and also the 
temperatures maxed so there's not that many events   and also I I guess I just needed the the mega 
credits right now in order to play this card so yeah methane from Titan didn't I play this yeah 
I I think I did I played methane from Titan and   then I played insulation afterwards and now 
I'm finally getting a city it's a little bit   late but I think Noctis City is still all right 
in this game mm-hmm it's still good for sure and we could get a little bit of energy 
production I don't think I'm actually   gonna keep this I don't think greenhouses 
looks very good it's actually funny so I   can get one Megacredit production per City or 
I can get one plant per City but uh taken into   account that the landlord has been started and 
the banker has not been started and also taken   into account and this is probably the second to 
last generation yeah definitely taking greenhouses yep this looks good I think geothermal power 
that's only because I pick up Noctis City right so so what about this uh Kelp farming the 
bonus by the way I should mention is not   really important right now yeah getting 
one more City makes sense so putting it   here and then I get Noctis City in my 
hand that makes a lot of sense because   now I can play place a Greenery in between 
my cities and it's gonna be kind of okay hmm but the landlord has been started scientists 
has been started I think I could probably get   a second place in in I don't know can I even 
do anything in landlord maybe I can with this   with this card I just picked 
up the thing is I have a lot   of plant production and also I 
just picked up this greenhouses and now I'm like all right maybe the 
game is going to close at seven that   would be fine for me that would be perfect for me so yeah I'm looking at cities so I have maybe I'm just looking at how many points 
I think my opponents has would it be good   for me to close at seven I think I think 
yes generally because I'm the terraformer but I could be doing some math here but definitely kelp farming man it's a 
good card so I'm also thinking about can   I actually close the game at seven and I 
don't think I can do it by myself because   there's both three greeneries and three 
water so it's probably it's very unlikely   so I think I just have to close 
it next generation instead so do I wanna Play Noctis City 
and Geothermal power can I even   it's like I think I could but it's 
not maybe I pick up I don't know I'm   like floating three gold by not playing 
it now but maybe I think they're more   maybe I'll pick pick up a better play could I 
even have played both am I stupid no I don't   think they're even good right because I also 
needed the energy production to play it yeah   then what am I talking about I'm not 
getting energy production and nothing else   um I I only want to play the energy 
production when I play Noctis City so yeah   that's definitely what it is I think this game is 
pretty interesting as well just because it's like   a clear-cut example of how to build your engine 
with only terraform rating and TR (heat) yeah this   is really starting to annoy me I noticed it right 
away but like now I'm I'm like is this really true   is this also the case with everyone else I suggest 
my computer where everything looks green but yeah it's a weird bug I've never had that bug before 
to be honest commercial District looks cool towing   a comet is actually like if I want to close the 
game you know closing like it gives me like two   points right away it's actually very tempting 
but I don't think I'm gonna do it I think the   game is gonna close either way I think commercial 
district is also a little bit too good and also   I'm thinking that maybe I have enough   greeneries I am actually keeping it I'm 
not sure I'm not sure if that's correct I mean it's a little bit of a trade-off right do I 
want to make absolutely 100 sure that the game is   going to close in this direction this generation 
then it makes a lot of sense to keep the the comet   but I think this is slightly better commercial 
district is a it's very tasty at this point but it's a hard call to be honest   and I'm only keeping commercial District I 
don't think I need any of the other stuff exactly because what I was saying before 
look at my plants I have 18 plants so I   think that's that's the reason why 
I shouldn't keep this other comet   because I could just start this generation 
making two Greeneries so yeah makes sense yeah I'm definitely making one more Greenery 
I just don't know where to put it yeah so   it's I have to keep track I have to keep track 
which of the green cities is actually my city   which is annoying but yeah I'm getting the last 
few available TR from the oxygen scale it's good   so now I'm thinking about I'm 
probably getting second place in   Landlord yes? maybe even first place am 
I because I still haven't played the uh all right and now people are getting water so now I actually should do the math here 
so I actually end up having like plenty   so there's a very interesting decision 
here a very important decision do I   make a one more City or do I just make 
a water for 18 and I think if I recall   I was a little bit lazy I didn't I didn't 
math it out all the way so I think I'm   I'm actually regretting not getting a standard 
water because someone else is probably gonna get   it and now I'm like oh poop now I'm I'm actually 
I'm at an awkward place where I don't have enough   okay Megacredits to make a Greenery but I did 
have enough Megacredits to make it water so but it might not be yet it might be soon but 
definitely something to to think about here but Noctis city and then greenhouses and then what I have left so I'm definitely 
considering getting another city but I don't   I don't want to do it yet right because I 
still wanna I wanna make absolutely sure   that the game closes so I think I'm also a 
little bit too locked into this mindset oh   man I hope my opponents are actually making this 
water because then I know the game's gonna close   so that is correct of course but also I I should 
have also kept in mind well maybe it's better for   me that I make this water because otherwise 
it's gonna be a little bit awkward for me   so I actually spent the last Megacredits I've left but yeah mm-hmm also the the plants is something I'm also thinking 
about it's actually very complicated yeah I'm   looking for look at my mouse I'm actually I'm 
planning out how to to place my greeneries as well   so I'm getting one water yeah I think 
that's a safe choice and then I'm getting   this steel of course yeah that makes 
sense because I want to play Noctis City   so the problem now is that with this two Steel I have 38 and then I want to place my noctic city and 
stuff and and the greenhouses how much is that   and then my problem is I don't have enough 
to actually get one more Greenery so yeah so I'm doing it like this but 
now look at my I'm actually needing   yeah so I think I would have enough to 
build the last water and then also play my   my greenhouses so yeah I was just about to make 
the last water and now I'm kicking myself that I   didn't do it before because I didn't do the 
math properly so it's a little bit annoying so once again if I start this last award which 
I'm not gonna not gonna win anyway I can't play   greenhouses so but there's a little bit I can do 
something because when I yeah exactly I can go for   this card so this is not actually my city this is 
next to my opponent's City but the thing is with   the few cities I have um I'm not gonna I'm gonna 
have a few bad greeneries it has no way around it   so I might as well just get this card and hope 
it can give me like one terraform rating so uh   that's the correct play to do right now but I only 
came in this position yeah see now I'm getting   I'm actually lucky I'm getting a card that I can 
exactly play and that's worth one Victory point   that's what I want but um I didn't have to get in 
this position I could have just made the water but   I didn't I was just a little bit lazy doing the 
math but if you if you see I could have made one   water and that would give me two Megacredits in 
a bonus in water adjacency bonus and then I would   have had exactly enough to play greenhouses 
anyway so it's a little bit of mistake here and also it's a little bit hard to see because 
everything is green but I think this could also   be the game where my last city was a little 
bit questionable (it's not) I think an idea   could have been to place my city before next 
to Noctis City (talking about another game) and   then play Noctis City afterwards 
(nope) but I it's a little hard to see   which which is my city and all this 
green mess man (I'm confused sry)   but yeah this is lucky so when everything is 
said and done I'm not getting the last TR from   the water but I'm getting one Victory point from 
this card so it's exactly the same but it's only   it's only because I was lucky and pick I might 
as well just picked up at dead card right so but yeah I'm I'm sorry everything is green it's 
uh but I thought the game was very interesting   nevertheless so I still chose to include this 
one it's such a very good game to show that   you know you could you don't have to build your 
engine with mega credits and stuff like this you   can also build your engine with heat production 
and terraform rating so this is like a perfect   example of how to do that and as you noticed even 
though I am going for this I'm still picking up   the the little bit of engine I got in the early 
game all I got was like two titanium production   but if I had like a little bit of Mega credit 
production in the first generation I probably   still would have played that right so um but 
mainly building your engine only from heat and   and terraform rating that's that's reasonable you 
can do this it makes a lot of sense especially if   your plan is to just close the game as soon 
as possible I would have liked to close it at   seven but you can't always get what you want so 
closing it a eight is also completely fine for me   and it actually ends up taking into 
account that there's only eight Generations   88 points in eight Generations is actually 
pretty good it's a good score actually   um so yeah uh thanks for watching 
and yeah see you for the next one :D
