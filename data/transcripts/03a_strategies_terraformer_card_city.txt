Hello welcome back to my Terraforming Mars 
strategy guide today's episode 3 and we're   gonna talk about strategies so these are some of 
the strongest strategies at least in my opinion so   here are the stuff we're gonna look at today so we 
got the major strategy the overall game plan I'll   talk about that in a second and then we got all of 
these minor strategies and to be honest the only   reason I call these minor strategies is just to 
imply that you can have more of these at once so   when I say the overall game plan or the major 
strategy what I mean is this aspect we talked   about in episode one do I want to aim for a long 
game or do I want to aim for a shoTR-heavy game   basically we have these four scenarios every 
single game of terraforming mars is going to   shape out to one of these scenarios number one you 
got the greedy engine so you want game to drag out   number two your opponent got the greedy engine so 
you want to close the game to actually punish the   greedy players number three you try to outgreed 
your greedy opponent also entirely reasonable   sometimes this will work out fine and number four 
all players are trying to end the game as soon   as possible at this almost never happens it's so 
boring man so in every single game you have to try   to figure out is it in your best interest to let 
the game drag out or do you have a better chance   of winning by being this filthy dirty terraformer 
we're gonna get back to that but then we should   look at some of the minor strategies as well and 
like I said the lack of better words such as call   these minor strategies implying that you can use 
more of these at once in a given game you can mix   and match these strategies however you want to the 
only strategy that doesn't really mix that well   with the others are the terraforming strategy and 
that makes sense right because the terraforming   strategy really wants to close the game as soon 
as possible and most of the other strategies we're   going to talk about today are gonna be aimed at 
long games I've actually attempted to make this   aspect a little bit clearer by labeling the minor 
strategies in the short game or long game in terms   of generation as I feel in most games not always 
but in most games some strategies are more suited   for shorter games whereas other strategies are 
more suited for longer games so hopefully in   this way it's like intuitive which strategies goes 
well together and which strategy does not go well   together so minor strategy number one refuse to 
terraform perhaps even to the point where you hold   on to your heat and your plants so this is aiming 
for the long game so especially in two or three   player games there is this annoying strategy where 
player just never plays terraforming cards or he's   even holding on to plants and heat just because 
that player has the biggest engine and he wants   the game to drag out it it's really annoying and 
then when he feels certain that this is indeed the   last generation no matter what it does then he 
just spends all of his stuff all of his plants   all of his Heat he's been holding on to the thing 
is all of the greedy strategies actually want the   game to go for as long as possible because 
they make the most VP in the last generation   and then if you let it go one more generation 
they're gonna make even more VP than you in the   last... new last generation so this is why it 
could be useful sometimes to hold on to either   your plants or your heat what I mean is getting 
plus one generation can make a huge difference   if for example you're the one going GODMODE it 
can really make a difference because the guy   who's going GODMODE he's gonna make so many VP in 
the last generation its insane as a side note you   can also stack up your heat to claim the water 
bonus on the oxygen scale it's actually pretty   common that people do this this bonus is really 
important so this is a way of fighting for that   bonus however holding on to plants and heat could 
also mean that you in the end miss out on some TR   which can also be a big deal so you have to like 
weigh the pros and cons here what I mean is if   you're holding on to a lot of plants or heat and 
then the parameter is going to close and you're   just you just didn't even notice or something 
and then you just sit with like a thousand heat   and you can't use it for anything it's not good 
what you really should do is you should identify   the last parameters to close and then you're gonna 
not terraform that too much if that makes sense so   if you recognize that the heat is the last one to 
close then you can hold on to your heat resources   and worth noting here if you intend to hold back 
plants you probably should have protected habitat   and I'm gonna show you a clip of boneless telling 
you how many plants he has I mean look at this I   have 60 plants 20 plant production and 60 plants 
and I haven't even played insects yet I know that   I want to close it at 14 so when he passes I'm 
gonna terraform like until there's like one spot   left or something if that makes sense so just it 
just barely goes to 14 Generations because then I   have getting the maximum out of the Terraform 
rating as well 32 plant production let's go that's a lot of plants in this game I went for 
an Omega greedy card strategy so in this case it   makes like a lot of sense to let the game drag 
out if you want to watch the whole game you can   check out episode 16 part 2. we are going to talk 
more about the greedy card strategy later in this   video minor strategy number three but before 
we do that let's talk about the polar opposite   strategy which is the filthy dirty terraformer so 
this is obviously best for short games so this is   where you just terraform like an absolute madman 
and try to end the game as soon as possible and   funny enough even though the strategy is the 
exact opposite of the first one it's equally   as annoying like if you're having a good game a 
greedy game and then this guy is just terraforming   it's so annoying the one the long game you want 
to have fun right so why so the idea here is you   try to close the game as soon as possible because 
then the guy with the really greedy big engine he   doesn't have time enough to actually make the 
transition from engine building to VP grabbing   so the way it's gonna shape out is you're gonna 
be ahead in the first half of the game hopefully   the entire game because you just keep making TR 
and keep trying to close the game so you can see   it like this that if you're the terraforming 
guy your VP is going to be like in a straight   line because you're just starting the game trying 
to get VP and by the end you still want to get VP   so that's a straight line whereas the greedy guy 
he's gonna have no VP to begin with because he's   making engine and then in the last few generations 
he's gonna Crush you if you let the game drag on   too long but the point is you want to end the 
game like like here before the greedy guy like   overtakes you in the end I hope this is not 
mirrored I'm not sure now it's important to   understand that you still need a little bit of 
money income yourself you still play the mega   credit cards you get in the early game you still 
have to climb out of the hole like we talked about   but in addition to money income in the early 
game you also value TR or plant production,   heat production and then you can like make a 
transition from engine building to TR pretty   early on and while this strategy is pretty boring 
not gonna lie it can be quite powerful it's a good   way to punish the greedy guy who invested so much 
into a ton of Mega credit production and card-draw   so if you see your opponent getting like 40 Mega 
Credit production more than you then this is   definitely a strategy you just have to consider 
I think only a few times I actually started the   game immediately thinking okay I'm gonna go all 
in for the terraforming strategy I did it on the   Mars App just so I could show you guys a game 
where I went for the strategy so here is the   starting hand I had in that game if you want to 
see the whole game it's in episode 17 I'm not   gonna lie this this hand is pretty terrible but 
I really didn't get much engine building cards in   my hand so I think I did the correct thing it just 
went for the terraforming strategy it is a little   bit questionable to keep insulation in my opening 
hand but this was a three player game so I just   wanted the option available to me that I could 
turn all the heat into Mega Credit production   and go for the greedy long game so this is also 
something I considered but I think in the name   of science I still just went for the terraforming 
strategy here I want to point out that winning a   game with this trash Society support is actually 
an achievement in and of itself I really want to   make myself clear here I I I truly I deeply I 
hate this Prelude Society support here's some   other examples of Corporations and cards you 
might want to pick up when you're going for   the strategy these are just examples but you can 
imagine heat production plant production naturally   stuff like this is what you're looking for and 
the funny thing is that even if you are running   this terraforming strategy even though you're all 
in and just trying to end the game even in this   case I still feel like Regolith Eaters and ghg 
producing bacteria are still sort of bad cards   I'm really not a fan of these cards however 
if you do happen to get extreme-cold fungus   combined with one of these cards then it's great 
of course one free TR every generation is actually   worth something it's like worth eight Mega credit 
production if you want to look at it that way at   least until the parameter closes and then it's 
once again pretty useless also heat production   is of course pretty nice when you're going through 
this combo so especially to keep your eye out for   some of these heat combos like we talked about 
in the first video so you could decide to play   the terraforming strategy based on your starting 
hand like I did here I mean sometimes you have a   starting hand it's like it's the only thing you 
have right and you have to play the cards you're   getting but to be honest most what I do is I 
Look to get the greedy engine up and running   and if I have just no luck building an engine 
as strong as my opponent then I will consider   to transition into the strategy instead also 
what I sometimes do is I try to compete with a   greedy guy I try to be greedy myself and if I feel 
like I'm Omega losing this war and I'm back to two   cards and he has like 20 cards then I can look to 
transition into the terraforming strategy and try   to close the game as soon as possible so this 
is also an idea I think you should always have   this strategy in the back of your head and finally 
you should also keep in mind that the terraforming   strategy is simply better in four or five player 
games in two player games the card strategy is   simply Superior I'm gonna go out on a limb here 
and say you should never play the terraforming   strategy in a two-player game three player games 
are even questionable in two player games the best   strategy is by far the greedy card strategy so 
let's talk about it I love this one full greed   aim to go GODMODE and this is of course better for 
long games the card strategy is the best strategy   for long greedy games and it is the best strategy 
for two player games for the same reason two play   games also usually longer and greedier like we 
mentioned in tip 8.5 if there are only two or   three players you should really aim to play the 
greedy card strategy every single game and then   you have no luck you can make a new plan but just 
really start the game out trying to do this the   greedy card strategy can also work in four to five 
player games but then it comes with a lot more   risk because four to five play games tend to be 
shorter in terms of generations in other words the   other strategies have a higher chance of beating 
you if we're talking about the four to five   player games so what defines the ultra greedy card 
strategy you might be thinking boneless excuse me   I actually do do this every time I always go for 
engine and cards of course so why is this like a   strategy isn't it just what you always do and not 
exactly it is true that what I mostly do is I try   to go for money income and card-draw but to go 
all in on this particular strategy is a little   bit different here's what I mean number one you 
keep all of the card-draw cards even some of the   bad ones you also probably keep the only way you 
don't keep car-draw cards with this strategy is if   you just have too many cards and too little engine 
then maybe you just don't keep all of them so all   of the card-draw cards are good when you play this 
strategy however, I would like to briefly mention   some of the absolute MVPs I'm talking about the 
cards where you draw a card when X happens the   thing is when you play the strategy you want to 
be playing like a million cards and if you're   playing a million cards naturally you're gonna see 
more Science Tags you're gonna see more cards that   cost 20 plus which means that these cards for 
example are especially juicy I'm talking Mars   University Olympus conference spin-off Department 
I don't think I've ever had a bad game where I   had Mars University and Olympus conference and 
spinoff department is just straight up one of   the best cards in the game it's literally broken 
especially if you get it early on I mean this card   is literally a goat you know what they are all 
goats these cards are just amazing especially for   the card strategy but even if you're not playing 
the card strategy these cards are still very good   AI Central is of course also one of the good ones 
especially if the game goes long and especially   if you can get it down pretty early on the thing 
about AI Central like I mentioned the first video   is it can be a little bit risky if the game only 
goes to like Seven Generations and then you spend   the entire game playing AI Central then you could 
be in trouble but for this particular strategy AI   Central is of course very nice so what else 
defines the card strategy two you want to   keep more cards and have a bigger hand size than 
normally it does happen sometimes actually that   I have 20 cards or maybe sometimes even 30 cards 
in my hand usually only two or three player games   though but if I do have all of these cards in my 
hand it means that I am all in on the greedy card   strategy worth noting you shouldn't just keep any 
card you see it's not like this the cards you keep   still have to be good and preferably you'll get 
a lot of them for free with card-draw and stuff   like this number three you create a huge engine 
of money income all of the cards you're getting   are only useful to you if you have a lot of Mega 
credit steel and titanium production so you can   actually buy all the stuff and as you probably 
know by now when I say money income this is the   stuff I mean it's all of this stuff is good 
number four do not terraform too much as you   want the game to drag out so we way back to this 
we talked about in the beginning the overall game   plan for this strategy you especially want the 
game to drag on for as long as possible so you   want to identify which of the three parameters 
is the last one to close and avoid terraforming   that for the most part or if it is the second last 
generation and everyone else has passed then what   you do is you terraform everything except one 
step number five get discount cards considering   that you aim to play more Cards than normally the 
secret juice to the card strategy is Discount all   of these cards here are just great if you're 
going for GODMODE what I mean is these types of   cards is how you just keep playing cards and keep 
playing cards when you go GODMODE all of a sudden   you have so much Synergy that you literally like 
receive Mega credits when you play a cheap space   event because you have so much discount like Media 
Group and advanced aerobreaking something if you   get to this point you are literally Unstoppable 
this is where the card strategy just (barking   noice) also meat Industry is really good same idea 
you just get stuff and worth noting meat Industry   is closely tied to the green tag strategy and the 
Green Tag strategy is very closely related to this   strategy I think so this just it just works well 
together number six look for resource amplifiers   we talked about this in Chapter 2 tip number 17 
but all of these resource amplifies they're like   perfect especially when you go for this strategy 
because you just want the biggest engine the world   has ever seen and these are the cards to get 
it with also you should look for these cards   that gets better the longer the game drags on 
once again we talked about this in the previous   video number seven look for VP amplifiers so of 
course we got the Jovian amplifiers the Jovian   strategy is also something you want to look at 
when you're going for this greedy card strategy   naturally and we will talk more about the Jovian 
Strat later it could also be like the Green Tag   amplifies some of these cards here just some of 
them but the Green Tag synergies in general can   actually give you even more Point than Jovian 
cards especially when you're going GODMODE and   you just play so many cards we will also talk 
about this later in this video in minor strategy   number six basically these seven points here 
this is what for me truly defines the greedy   card strategy and the theme here of course is 
you want to play as many cards as possible and   to play so many cards naturally you want strong 
card-draw you want Card discount you want a big   engine you want amplifiers you want everything so 
with this strategy specifically your late game VP   mainly comes from all the cards you've played all 
the green tag synergies all the numbers on the   cards stuff like this Jovian amplifies microbes 
animals all of this really good so like we also   talked about in the first video the formula is 
money income multiplied with card-draw if these   two things multiplied with each other exceeds 
a thousand then you have truly achieved GODMODE and you will win I actually prepared a clip that 
reflects exactly how I'm feeling when I like one   out of 100 games managed to go full GODMODE I'm 
just gonna run the clip actually going full god   mode is a state of mind that encapsulates 
the peace and tranquility and happiness and   fulfillment you find yourself in when you have 
a ton of money and you can play a ton of cards   every single generation to get the best effect of 
going full GODMODE you need to have a good engine   you need to have a lot of card-draw and preferably 
you also need to have some good discount cards but   when you're going full GODMODE you will know about 
it because it feels exactly like this video here   this is GODMODE so let's break down the starting 
hand because I feel like the starting hand just   screams GODMODE why does this scream GODMODE 
because I have both a ton of card-draw and a ton   of Mega credit production amplifiers and like I 
said you need both so we got Teractor and Credicor   pretty similar corporations in this case of course 
I went for Teractor as I already have two Earth   amplifiers in my hand so the Earth tag is worth a 
lot more than the no tag and Credicor and also I   already have a couple of Earth tags whereas I only 
have one card that costs 20 plus so of course I'm   gonna go for Teractor here I would have liked to 
have Point Luna instead it would have been better   but you know you can't get everything the preludes 
here are not the best to be honest they are pretty   average nothing exciting however two of them does 
come with a science tag so I chose those two why   the science tag well because I want to play AI 
Central in the first generation it's very good   and I actually can play AI Central in the first 
generation which is huge this is like really why   this starting hand is so good however to do that I 
still need to get the third science tag to play AI   Central but what we have here Olympus conference 
one of the best cards in the game especially for   this strategy yeah we got this also worth noting 
that the preludes even though they're not that   good they do draw me four cards and I actually 
need that because I need one more Science Tag   and I need all the Earth tags I can get then I 
kept tectonic stress power just because I needed   some energy production to play AI central that's 
pretty much what it is I did actually calculate   this out that I had enough Mega credit to both 
play tectonic Stress power and AI Central thanks   to the 60 Mega credit I got from Teractor if 
I had fewer Mega credits from my Corporation I   might have actually just bought a standard project 
instead of a tectonic stress power all of this is   of course in the service of getting AI Central 
in the first generation then we've got business   Network really nice Earth tag and even more card 
draw and finally I got the mass converter which is   just the cherry on top technically I do need one 
more science tag in order to play this but with   all of this card draw I have no doubt that I'll 
pick up one more science tag so just a perfect   opening hand to go GODMODE like I'm not kidding 
when I saw this hand I immediately knew that I was   gonna win the game by having the a double amount 
of points as my enemies it's really this matters   so much if you want to you can watch this entire 
game with commentary it's episode 16 part 1 and   then we have another game where when even more 
GODMODE than this one and got 278 Victory point   and that is episode 16 part 2 the card strategy 
is the most fun strategy to play in my opinion   and it's also like I mentioned the strategy that 
can by far create the high scores yes you can   also achieve high scores with cities and stuff but 
with the card strategy this is how you can get the   really high scores and this also of course like 
we talked about in the first video is due to the   fact that the cast strategy is a stepping stone 
to every other strategies except for maybe the   filthy dirty terraforming strategy in real life 
the best game I've had is 280 on generation 11 in   the two-player game with preludes Venus colonies 
so no Turmoil no fanmade content and how did I do   it you guessed it I had the greedy card strategy 
in that game I also had a pretty early AI Central   and I had Viron and this combo is really good so 
that is like four free cards every generation on   top of that I had a god-like earth tag opening 
hand with a few Earth tag Mega credit amplifiers   so this game was just really good so like we 
said if you have both card-draw and money income   you go GODMODE and speaking of Corporations here 
are a few examples of Corporations which are quite   nice when you're going for the card strategy to 
be honest there are too many good corporations to   name these are just some example but like you 
probably guessed it's all about getting money   income from your corporation and card-draw if 
possible a lot of people don't like Point Luna   that much which I kind of don't understand at 
least for the card strategy this Corporation is   like perfect sometimes it just gives you a ton of 
cards and the one titanium production is nice for   engine plus the Earth tag so if you're lucky you 
get some Mega credit amplifiers with Earth tags   and it it just it's awesome man but it really 
also depends on number of players I rang this   bell before but like Point Luna is actually 
better than two player games compared to five   player games because in five play games the card 
strategy is not that good and the next strategy   here will actually compare Point Luna to Tharsis 
good poop let's go minor strategy number four the   city strategy so this is a strategy that both 
suits short games and can also suit long games   so this is kind kind of a special one I'll show 
you what I mean so for long games for example   if you build all the cities on the map you kind 
of need time to fill up the rest of the map with   greeneries like it could be the case that you 
played tharsis you have immigrant City Martian   rails you're vibing you're spamming cities like 
an absolute Maniac covering the entire planet   with cities so in the second half of the game 
you really want to cover all the spaces between   your cities with greeneries otherwise it's a 
big waste so in this case it could be in your   interest to let the game drag out simply because 
you just need all the time you can get to place   all the greeneries in between your cities the key 
is to match the number of cities with number of   greeneries by the end of the game if you build 
too many cities while getting too few greeneries   you will lose the game so in Long games you can 
actually play a mix of both the cards strategy   and the city strategy and this might be better for 
you so when is it good to go for the City strategy   in short games you can use cities and greeneries 
kind of a way to close the oxygen and the game   pretty early on perhaps it's also in your interest 
to close the game as soon as possible because   you see the opponents are going for the Ultra 
Mega greedy late game if this is the case you can   actually use the City Strategy in conjunction with 
the terraforming strategy this could be kind of   good for you because then you just need someone to 
have heat production it could be yourself because   naturally you are going to have plant production 
when you play with cities usually it's the oxygen   or the temperature that's the last one to end the 
game but even if it is the water it's actually not   so bad for you because you can just buy water 
from the cards or the water standard project   and in the process you'll get a lot more plants 
and also you'll get some nice water placement   bonuses and also some nice placement bonuses 
for your series and your greeneries to boot   also worth noting in short games the scores are 
low which means that the VP you're getting from   your Cities and greeneries could be enough for 
you to win the game so what I'm really trying   to say here is that the city strategy is usually 
better in four or five player games because first   of all the card strategy won't have enough time to 
beat you and also in four or five player games the   opponents are more likely to feed your three Mega 
credit production by building cities all over the   map this is if you have Immigrant City, Tharsis or 
Martian Rails of course and also like we mentioned   the city strategy plus the terraforming strategy 
combo is just greater in shorter games and usually   four to five player games are shorter in terms 
of generation and then if you go to two to three   player games it's kinda exactly the opposite 
which makes sense so in two or three-player   games the card strategy will likely beat you 
your opponents are less likely to feed your mega   credit production by building cities in the early 
game because they are fewer people and they care   more about not helping your opponent and also the 
city strategy plus terraforming strategy combo is   straight up bad in longer games it really is the 
thing is in two player games you will play to hurt   your opponent because this one opponent is now a 
hundred percent of your opponents if that makes   sense this is also why Attack cards are generally 
better in two-player games and getting hit by   Attack cards actually matters a lot if you're 
going for plant production which by association   also matters a lot if you're going for cities 
when it comes to burning plants and stuff it's   actually not so clear in this case because there 
are some factors to consider here in five player   games there are more people who can draw asteroids 
and also worth noting the cards that usually burn   plants are mostly TR related cards and cards that 
gives you TR are very popular in five player games   that being said the two players in a two-player 
game have a lot more cards than the 5 players   and the five player game and all I'm saying is 
if you're playing two players and he gets an   asteroid then of course it will hit you but to be 
clear I actually think plant production is really   good regardless of player number in five player 
games you care less about hurting or helping an   opponent because this opponent is only 25 of your 
opponents so what I'm trying to say is in five   player games you're really only playing to help 
yourself it doesn't matter that much if you're   hurting one out of five opponents it's better 
to help yourself that being said if you have the   opportunity of burning four plus plants from an 
enemy player in a five player game you still will   of course consider it depending on the guy you're 
hurting maybe it's your rival to win the game or   something and it also depends if the asteroid 
you're playing is good for you maybe there's a   bonus or something and also and this is probably 
the most important part is just very satisfying to   hurt other people in board games in the second 
video in tip number 18 I also talk a bit more   about this stuff but as you probably Gather By Now 
by this insane rambling I just did it's a bit of a   gray area so many things to consider to be honest 
however that being said returning to the point   I'm still 100 convinced that the city strategy is 
better in four to five player games and the city   strategy is worse in two to three player games 
here is an example that really Nails how much   I believe in this statement I will go so far and 
this is maybe crazy to you but I will go so fast   to say this in two player games I think tharsis 
is a b-tier Corporation and I think Point Luna is   an S-tier with a goat however in five player games 
I actually think tharsis is an S-tier with a goat   and point Luna is a b-tier you might think what 
are you crazy point Luna is better than tharsis   Boneless you crazy but no I'm actually not kidding 
this is I I believe in this and I should probably   Gather By Now this sort of insane statement is 
tied to the fact that I think the card strategy   is better in two player games whereas the city 
strategy is better in five player games like   in four to five play games you can actually just 
choose Tharsis and even if you don't get any other   good City synergetic cards you could just have 
this Corporation anyway and just wait for others   to build some cities once in a while and it's not 
terrible but of course in most cases if you are   picking Tharsis it's because you yourself want to 
play cities that's that's the safer way to go and   if you don't believe Luna can be really good in 
two player games this is actually the corporation   I used to get 278 on the Mars App and like we 
mentioned you can check that game out episode 16   part 2 if like you want to experience the full 
potential Frieza Dragon Ball final form of how   good point Luna can be if you're going for the 
Card Strategy final thing I want to add to this   is that Tharsis and Point Luna these are never bad 
corporations B-tier is pretty good you could even   make an argument for A-tier not important but I 
really hope that this example Nails home how I   actually think about strategies in General so in 
my opinion there are two ways to play the city   Strat one you go 50 all-in on the city Strat so 
this is better for two or three player games maybe   you didn't get as much City Synergy as you had 
hoped you kind of want to focus on other things   also you mainly use cards to build your engine 
you're playing a lot of cards also it could happen   that you just have really good cards and you want 
to play them too and this is totally fine so you   build cities whenever it's convenient for you and 
you can play other cards whenever it's convenient   for you and finally you do need some plant 
production even if you're only 50 all in you still   need a fair bit amount of plant production so 
you're of course still looking for some of these   plant amplifiers or plant production in general of 
course very good when you're going for cities and   then there's the other way of playing the city 
strat which is full YOLO all-in so in this case   you have a lot of City synergies the cards are 
kind of bad or maybe you have so good City Synergy   that you can just focus on building cities instead 
and build your engine this way if you have only   one effect like let's say you have immigrant City 
for example and then you still consider building   the build the city standard project this is a very 
desperate play it's not good because then you play   25 Mega credit for 2 Mega credit production this 
is not efficient cities are mainly a way to get   VP in the late game they're not so great for 
building engine so you do need a lot of support   if you really want to go all in and just build 
your engine with cities even if you're all in full   YOLO on cities you still want to play some of the 
really good Cards you get but the cards you play   has to be really good I think the mistake that 
people sometimes make is that if they're going   all-in on cities then they still keep a little 
too many cards than they should I'm actually   also guilty of this it's one of the games I have 
on my channel you really have to be very picky of   which cards you actually keep if you're like full 
YOLO all in on cities and then of course you need   a lot of plant production like if you're going all 
in on cities you need all the plant production you   can get and speaking of the city and the greenery 
standard project I'm not gonna spend too much time   because we talked about this in the last video 
but I thought it would still be relevant to just   mention this so when is it good to buy the City or 
the greenery as standard projects so to start with   greeneries 1 you need to close the game 2 you want 
the last few available TR when the parameter is   about to close 3 you can get the temperature bonus 
on the oxygen scale 4 you're close to playing a   good card with oxygen requirement and it pretty 
much has to be like one of the good cards it has   to be like birds, insects, Zeppelins something 
like this and 5 in the late game you can actually   use cities and greeneries to get VP it's actually 
quite nice it's pretty efficient so you have to do   the math is it better to use your cards or is it 
better to just Spam cities and greeneries because   greeneries are mainly three victory points sort 
of one Victory point for Greenery one for oxygen   and one next to your city so what about cities 
versus greeneries I've gotten this question a   few times when is it better to actually build a 
city and when is it better to build the greenery   especially in the late game as a rule you really 
want to place your cities next to at least two   greeneries also be precise when the game is over 
the city actually has to be adjacent to at least   three greeneries because if it's only next to 
two greeneries then it's actually like two Mega   credit more cost effective to build the greenery 
next to your city instead but then you could also   take into account that the city gave you one Mega 
credit production just know that a Greenery next   to your city that's like 2vp but if the oxygen 
is not closed yet then this is better because   then it would be 3vp so the math is kind of this 
if you place a Greenery next to one of your own   cities then that is two points so usually this is 
better than placing a city next to two greeneries   but maybe this city can have even more greeneries 
by the end of the game so it's really hard to say   and then we have other factors as well if the 
map is filling up you should also get some of   the good City placements while you can so because 
of this you can also make the argument that it's   a little bit better to play cities first while 
they have a lot of good spots for cities and then   later on you build greeneries around your cities 
so cities in Greenery is are mainly a way to get   VP which is why these are often used in the late 
game because like we alluded to cities are pretty   bad for engine building unless you have a lot of 
City Synergy and to be clear you have to have like   really good City Synergy to Warrant building this 
terrible City standard project in the early game   in my opinion you really have to have two of these 
three cards here why are these three cards extra   good I think well that's because they give Mega 
credit production whenever a city is placed if you   play one energy to get one gold every generation 
per City that's the same as getting like immigrant   City so let's actually compare these two guys I 
think people tend to underestimate Martian rails   I think this card is actually really good I would 
argue that Martian Rails is slightly stronger than   the Immigrant City but it's kind of a close call 
because yes immigrant City it gives you a city   right off the bat but then on the other hand 
it gives you minus two Mega credit production   to play and then you get one back so it's really 
like one Mega credit production minus and both of   these cards kinda cost one energy production when 
you think about it and both of these cards kinda   gives you one Mega credit production every time a 
city is placed so they're really similar but there   are small differences though the advantages of 
Martian Rails is that the gives you Mega Credits   in the same generation as you play it so that's 
like slightly better than just getting passive   Mega credit production on the flip side Then 
You're vulnerable to cards that steal your energy   production but there are only two of those and 
that doesn't happen that often the small advantage   of immigrant City however is that it also works 
on off-world cities Martian rails and Zeppelins   they do not work on off-world cities and the mega 
credit production aspect of Tharsis does not work   on off-world cities either let's talk about 
immigrant City because this card is actually   pretty wild it can sometimes sit straight up win 
you the game and sometimes it actually loses you   the game without you even knowing about it so 
the trick is to actually understand when exactly   to use this card the thing is it actually takes a 
while for immigrant City to kick in and you can't   know if your opponent will help you build cities 
after you play Immigrant City and in a game that's   all about this snowball effect you have to be 
really careful when you're spending this much   like 13 Mega credits three for the cards and an 
energy production for something that essentially   gives you minus Mega credit production however 
down the road immigrant City can give you so much   I have no doubt that it's a good card but you 
really have to be careful here so when exactly   should you play this card first of all you need 
to play it at the start of the generation if this   is the generation you decide to play Immigrant 
City play it as soon as possible because usually   people tend to start the generation building 
cities so getting immigrant City down as soon   as possible is pretty key and also if you plan on 
playing immigrant City you kind of need to have a   plan to build more cities yourself you can't 
just rely on other people building cities and   pumping this up for you or can you maybe you could 
because maybe you have a read that someone else is   about to build a city maybe they are playing 
tharsis or maybe you play draft and you pass   along some good City cards like research outpost 
or something or maybe just predict that people   are about to compete for the Mayor Milestone so 
if you have a read like this then it would be   entirely reasonable to just slam down immigrant 
City so like I said if you play against Tharsis   and you just play Immigrant City well now you also 
Tharsis with one card you completely canceled out   the bonus of his Corporation that's a little bit 
funny when that happens and finally you can also   just play Immigrant City and just like hope you 
get lucky but I mean this is really risky I'm   not so sure this is a good idea then we got other 
city synergetic cards like these these are cards   that are definitely cards you are looking for 
when you're playing cities but for the purposes   of engine building these by themselves are not 
really enough and if you really want to play   this trash standard project in the early game 
then you kind of need to have two of The Big   Three like immigrant City Matian Rails Tharsis 
then you might be thinking why is Zeppelins not   up there that also gives a mega credit production 
based on cities but the thing is the five oxygen   requirement and Zeppelins just makes this card so 
unreliable sometimes it takes a long time for the   oxygen to even go there and by that time then the 
mega credit production you get is not really that   much of a big deal because maybe we're already 
in the mid to late game where Zeppelins truly   shine is when you just top-deck it in the early 
to mid game where the oxygen is close to five and   then you can maybe even just build a Greenery 
just to get this down and it feels really good   however the biggest issue with this card in 
my opinion is that you cannot keep it in your   opening hand because it's just too unreliable so 
you kind of just have to hope that you top-deck   this card at the right time and if you do that it 
can be very strong it's very awkward to keep this   in your opening hand because you just never know 
how much time it will take before the five oxygen   requirement has been met but what if you don't 
have immigrant City Martian rails or Tharsis or   maybe you just have one of these cards what is 
your plan then let's say for instance you picked   up a card like pets so pets doesn't really give 
you any Mega credit production or Mega credits or   anything it's only a card to get VP and normally 
a ring this bell that VP should be played in the   second half of the game or the end of the game or 
something like this but this is kind of different   right because this card gives a lot of VP during 
the game it actually gives more VP the earlier you   put it down so this is one of these luxury cards 
as I see it that you can play in the early game   if your economy can handle it and if your economy 
is still struggling you kind of want to get your   engine building cards down first in that case 
you can still play it in the mid game and it's   still gonna be fine I think the mistake that some 
players make is oh I gotta get Pets down as soon   as possible in the first generation and it's not 
that important to get it down that early what I'm   saying is that it might actually ruin your chances 
of building an efficient engine if you just play   cards like these in the first first generation 
it's okay to wait until the mid game before you   play a card like Pets and you might be thinking 
oh but I'm missing out on free VP nah but what   you're getting in return is like 10 mega credits 
you could have spent an engine so it's it's like   a trade-off you have to make the assessment it's 
more important for me to make a good engine here   and now it's more important to just slam down 
Pets however needless to say if anyone around   the table is going for cities you are going to 
play Pets Pets is a stupidly strong card or you   could just play it because you're sitting with 
like Miranda Resort and you need the Earth Tag   or something immigration shuttles is also a card 
that I should mention here at the end of the game   it gives you like one VP per three cities placed 
so if you get like 12 or 15 cities then it's kind   of good because then it'll give three or four 
victory points at the end of the game it also   depends when you can play it it's one of these 
cards well if if I don't really have anything   to build my engine with I might as well take 
this one but it's not efficient because 31 for   5 Mega credit production it's a very slow way to 
build your engine but if you have nothing better   and you are going for cities then why not this 
card feels to me a little bit like a sort of a   Jovian amplifier if you're going for cities but 
by the end of the game there really should be   like 12 or 15 cities on the map for this card to 
be worth it I think and it doesn't have to be only   your cities it can also be everyone else's cities 
Rover Construction is another card that's just so   cheap and so good that you just play if anyone is 
going for cities you just play Rover construction   it's really cheap it comes from the VP and you 
don't have to place a lot of cities for this   card to to just pay for itself so I think this 
card is really good also a thing to keep in mind   is everyone including myself we all are we have to 
get mega credit production and stuff like this but   getting 2 Mega Credit production every time a city 
is placed it's pretty good as well like if you   think about it if there are only two generations 
left in the game then this card Rover construction   it's like better than actually getting one Mega 
credit production so it's also a little bit about   when you play it but this card is so cheap 
it's like Pets is one of these luxury cards   I'll just play it whenever I have the opportunity 
and naturally if you are planning to build cities   yourself of course it would be nice if you could 
play Rover construction before start building your   cities standard projects kind of the same thing if 
you're going for the build-a-city standard project   this is really good especially for the late game 
when you're building a lot of these I feel like   I've talked plenty about standard technology 
it's a good card greenhouses is a deceptively   strong card if you think about it if you only have 
like eight cities on the map then you can get a   Greenery down for six Mega credits if I'm Tharsis 
I might even keep this in my opening hand just so   I can play it in the late game this card is like 
really strong in the last generation or you can   also use this card to get the temperature bonus on 
the oxygen scale make a play like this it's also   fine but mostly I think I would play this in the 
last generation it's a perfect card if you're all   in on Cities and then you slam this in the last 
generation you'll get like two or three greeneries   that you could just put in between your cities 
now a few things to keep in mind when you're   playing the city strategy sooner or later all 
players should build at least one city it doesn't   matter if you're going for the city strat or not 
no matter what Strat you're going for really you   should have one city placed on the map at some 
point in the game and the reason this is useful   information is that if you are like claiming all 
the good City spots on the map let's say you have   Tharsis and immigrant City and stuff like this 
like if you're really lucky and you just can   get away with like building a lot of cities and 
building your engine this way in that case you're   kind of forcing people to sooner or later get one 
of the good last available city spots and people   might even start to panic a little bit because 
they can see oh poop I have to get at least one   of the good available spots left and this could 
be kind of nice because then they're feeding your   free Mega credit production and additionally maybe 
they feel forced to place down a city sooner than   they would have liked instead of going for their 
own plan they kind of feel oh poop I have to get   one city that's like five greeneries around it or 
something so you're a little bit disrupting their   plans maybe but that being said that is also a 
little bit of a double-edged sword because when   you're playing this Golden City strat and you 
have cities all over you kind of don't want an   enemy City in the middle of your Empire so placing 
your city strategically is to avoid people just   griefing you with a city in the middle of your 
Empire that's also something you have to think   about now you need to know when to stop spamming 
cities like I mentioned this is like literally the   hardest thing about playing the city strategy 
is knowing when to stop if you're building too   few cities then your engine might not be good 
enough and you're not getting all the good City   spots but then again if you're building too many 
cities then you won't have time enough to build   greeneries around your cities there's also this 
aspect of it being a little bit of an illusion you   always think you made the wrong choice but maybe 
you really didn't maybe it's just because your   opponents are reacting to the fact that they're 
like all right he's making more cities now we have   to close the game so the game could just be over 
sooner than you predicted and it's also this thing   like if you're building cities having a good time 
you're building a bunch of cities getting Mega   credit production this is fun man this is really 
fun it's like you have to force yourself to stop   having fun because you need to force yourself to 
be a responsible adult not placing cities all over   the map sometimes you just need to stop a little 
earlier even though it's a lot of fun you just   have to stop a little early and start building 
greeneries around your cities otherwise you're   gonna lose that's all I'm saying but maybe it's 
not about winning maybe it's about having fun   putting cities everywhere as I'm sure you know by 
now VP comes from greeneries around your cities   the cities themselves does not give any VP so 
you have to make greeneries around the cities   to actually score some VP at the end of the game 
if you get no greeneries you get no VP from your   cities because the city strategy really goes hand 
in hand with plant production I think most people   know this but I don't think people realize that 
if you get like a lot of plant production let's   say you get kelp farming with ecology experts 
Prelude or you get some some sort of insane   plant production going then you really should do 
the city Strat to some extent you really should   place a lot of cities so you can take all the 
greeneries down and that's probably going to be   enough for you to win the game so the city strat 
can be if you're Tharsis or something but the   city Strat can also come if you are ecoline or you 
get like a lot of plant production somewhere these   two things are linked together plant production 
City Strat these two are like two halves of the   same coin if that makes sense now let's look at 
another insane starting hand I had once again if   you want to watch the full game it's episode 
18 part one this hand just screams going for   cities I mean going all in on cities this hand 
is really good let's talk about why then we got   exactly the combo I said before I think I got the 
name wrong but what I'm talking about is ecology   experts and kelp farming this combo is insane so 
look what you're getting with this combo you're   getting two Mega Credit production two plants and 
four plant production and a victory point and two   plant tags which can also be really good because 
I have Insects here so the other Prelude here is   uh pretty bad I mean the funny thing is that 
even with this golden starting hand I got I'm   going for cities I'm going for plant production 
even then this early settlement still feels like   a bad prelude card I don't know man this card is 
really bad but if there was ever a game where I   really should try to make this early settlement 
Prelude work it should be now right the funny   thing is even with this Golden City starting hand 
I might actually have made a mistake not taking   donation over early settlement the argument 
for donation here is that I'm starting with   IO mining Industries so there's an argument 
to be made that you play donation and then   you're like in the second generation maybe you 
can play IO mining Industries in this case and   speaking of IO mining Industries I'm not sure 
I should have kept this card I mean it's it's   so tempting right get IO Mining Industries in 
your opening hand oh man it feels good and if   you're gonna watch the game like in hindsight I 
know that this was a bad call because I ended up   having only one Jovian and that was IO Mining 
Industries and in that case it's just simply   not worth it also keep in mind that this is a 
four player game so the game is going to be over   pretty soon so all things considered I don't 
think it should have kept IO mining Industries   even though it hurts my heart but I really don't 
think I should have kept this card I needed to   just have enough discipline to just say all right 
I'm going all in on cities that's all I'm gonna do   it's gonna be plenty enough to win the game no 
problem I don't need IO Mining Industries it's   kind of not the strat I'm going for that's 
what I should have done but it's really hard   to just not keep IO mining Industries in your 
opening hand I'm sure you guys can relate then   we got Bribed Committee one of these well I think 
this card is okay it gives like two Mega Cradit   production for 10 mega credits so it's kinda on 
the weak side but I think the play here would   have been to keep Bribed Committee and then throw 
away IO mining Industries I think that's what I   should have done that would have been better and 
then we also got Development Center I could have   kept this if I kept the power generation it would 
have been all right but then I'm not getting the   plant production and the city and you know my my 
strategy is kind of all in on cities so I really   have to be picky which cards do I keep and when 
do I just go all in on cities then we got worms   for once I actually kept this card but that's 
because I have three microbe tags already and   it's also worth noting that worms and insects they 
have a high oxygen requirement but I have so much   Plant production in this hand that it's gonna be 
no problem for me to raise the oxygen so I can   actually play these cards there we go robotic 
Workforce also a card I maybe shouldn't have   kept it's a little bit greedy but I think my idea 
was that I could use this on early settlement so   at the very least I can get one plant production 
with this card so in that case it's like adapted   Lichen but without the plant tag so that actually 
sounds really bad when I say it out loud so even   though I get a really good starting hand like this 
there's still a lot of things you have to consider   but that being said when I see the starting hand I 
have no doubt that I'm gonna win the game and once   again especially considering that this is a four 
player game the card strategy is not gonna beat me   because the game is gonna probably be short so I'm 
feeling very confident this this is a very good   starting hand for going for cities a little bonus 
with the city Strat is that a lot of Milestone   and awards actually fits with the city strategy so 
if we got the vanilla map here then we have Mayor   Gardener and Landlord so these are two milestones 
and one award that caters to the landlord this is   why the city strategy is a Little Bit Stronger 
on the vanilla map here three cities easy three   Gardener easy landlord obviously but on the other 
Maps there usually are like two things that caters   to the city strategy so here on the Hellas map 
we got the polar Explorer I mean you can start   the game by making a few cities down there if 
you want you can also play it further north   to get some of the good plants but this is 
something to keep in mind also the cultivator   like I said the city strategy goes hand in hand 
with plants so it makes a lot of sense to also   go for the cultivator and on Elysium kind of the 
same story we got Desert Settler and we got Estate   Dealer it's a little bit awkward that the desert 
settler wants you to play cities in the South and   the estate dealer wants you to play cities in 
the north but you know if you're going all in   the cities you're probably have cities everywhere 
so it's kind of good also a little bonus if you're   playing tharsis on this map is that there is this 
Olympus moons which has three cards so no matter   what I do if I play Tharsis I would always put a 
city there I think and then you might be thinking   but then you're only getting like maybe two plants 
around that City and yeah that's kind of true but   I think I would still take the three cards to be 
honest it's just too good to pass up there's also   a spot with three plants also worth noting that's 
also really good how to counter the city strategy   so what do you do if the opponent is playing the 
city strategy there's a few things you can do it's   actually not that hard to counter you can play 
City synergetic cards yourself if you're playing   against Tharsis or something just play Pets 
just play Immigrant City the thing about City   synergetic cards is that they work when opponents 
are building cities so even though you're not   planning to build so many cities yourself if 
you're playing against Tharsis just slam down Pets   or something and then he will just keep giving you 
a lot of stuff during the game you don't even have   to do anything so if you play like immigrant City 
you're completely canceling out the effect of his   cooperation because now if he wants to build City 
then he's gonna give gold to himself and you also   you can just place a bunch of annoying tiles in 
the middle of his Empire so this way to counter   the city Strat is also pretty straightforward just 
consider keeping cards that has a placement bonus   and just use it to disrupt his little pattern and 
just put it in the middle of his Empire he's gonna   be so salty about it and you can even do this in 
the late game so in the late game if you pick up   like for free maybe a card like mining area 
or industrial center then these cards they're   pretty bad at this point but you can still use 
them to just be a little terrorist so you're   kind of playing these cards as if they were Attack 
cards they don't really do anything for you not in   the late game but you can just play them because 
they're cheap and they're gonna like deny him a   couple of points it's really annoying number three 
just build a total of 1-2 cities and I'm talking   about just during the game at some point you 
don't have to do it at the start of the game in   that case you're just gonna give him make a credit 
production the thing is you always want to have at   least one city on the map and the reason you put 
it in the middle of his Empire is first of all to   disrupt his plan is gonna be really annoying for 
him you're gonna deny him a lot of points and if   you manage to put it like smack in the middle of 
his Empire then he's probably gonna have to like   at least Place some greeneries around your city 
because it's also helping himself right so you're   gonna get a little bit of extra value for free 
this way and finally you can just forget about   him and just focus on your own game the thing 
is I think people are maybe hyping up Tharsis   a little bit too much like it's not that strong 
I mean you can just focus on your own game and   maybe you'll beat him just by playing cards or 
playing your own strategy you really don't have   to play his game if that makes sense this chapter 
ended up being a little bit long so I thought just   here at the end I would just give a little bit of 
summation of what we have learned in this chapter   so 1 you got a lot of city synergetic cards 
obviously then you are inclined to go for cities   immigrant City Martian rails Tharsis these are 
probably the strongest ones but there are a lot   of good cards for city synergy so if you get 
some of these cards or some of the other cards   I'm not mentioning here sure go for it and two if 
you've got a lot of plant production you should   really consider going for cities so these are 
some of the plant amplifiers if you get some   of this stuff cities are definitely on the menu 
you are in a four or five player game like we   talked about I'm pretty confident that the city 
strategy in general is stronger in four or five   player games and you can also play it in two 
three player games but then it should be like   half City Strat and half card strategy especially 
in two player games you just have to go for the   card strategy and then if you're also on top of 
that get some City synergetic cards perfect you   can do both that being said if your entire hand 
just screams cities it's still fine right just   know that it comes with a lot more risk and two 
or three player games and finally you play on the   standard map with Mayor Gardener landlord then 
the city strat is a little bit extra good and   that's pretty much it for this episode it went a 
little bit longer than I thought so I'm gonna cut   this in two so in the second half we're gonna talk 
about Jovian tags and green tags so thank you so   much for watching as always if you have anything 
you want to debate with me any strategy I might   have been missing here or something feel free 
to mention in the comments thanks for watching
