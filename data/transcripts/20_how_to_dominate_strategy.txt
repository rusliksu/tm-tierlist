there are two major strategic approaches 
to terraforming Mars This playthrough will   look at the first of these which is the 
terraforming approach that rushes The   End Game and minimizes engine building I'll be 
talking strategy with a skilled Danish player   boneless and will analyze his choices 
in this game this is legendary tactics alright boneless tell me what you're thinking for 
your corporation selection and your Prelude cards   here yeah the cooperation I'm trusting Omni uh 
today and the the preludes uh is actually a big   choice because I also had the Prelude with the two 
titanium production and I if I remember I made a   few misplaced in this game this is like you could 
you could count this as one of them because I   think it would be slightly better to actually take 
the two titanium production but the reason I did   what I did here yeah in the planetary cinematics 
is I'm not so fond of this cooperation I don't   have a lot of building Tech so yeah I'm gonna go 
home I'm gonna go terraforming with a sound so uh   so this is going to be the the rush strategy then 
you're gonna try to close this game out quickly   exactly and so I'm I'm choosing the equifier here 
and I'm not sure it's a it's a good choice it's   it makes a lot of sense of course because uh I 
am trying to close the game early and there's   also this hidden bonus that I believe I did the 
math here and I I calculated that I could play a   nuclear Zone and I could play a giant space mirror 
thanks to the to Titanium I can get with the water   and the fact that I don't have to play five Mega 
credits for the other Prelude so there's a little   bit of logic here but everything being said and 
done I I remember when I played this I felt all   right it was probably not the right choice but you 
know I just want a terraform today right okay now   the interplanetary cinematics you didn't choose 
that Corporation but they they get an extra 20   steal off the Hop so why would you not go that 
way would that be that's not as useful for this   build uh I think the only thing I have here steel 
works with the building tag so that's not really   enough and I don't really have a lot of events if 
I recall so it didn't really make much sense and   I think the reason only is kind of strong in this 
the uh the game is that I have this uh um steel uh   oh God what's called I just said it the one that 
works yeah still works yeah yeah uh so so what I   can do is I can make four energy production in the 
first generation nice and then what I can do is I   can use steel works I can buy that in the second 
generation so this means that I'll have access to   one free TR every generation thanks to the steel 
works and this is how I can just easily use only   every single generation oh so you're just going 
to be cranking up the victory points yeah yeah   it's okay and you're you're also going to rush 
the terraforming rating because of the you and   me power yes for sure um well what do you mean I 
mean only it just gives me a flat TR the effect of   owning but but obviously to to get the requirement 
for only I would have to be terraforming so that's   why it makes a lot of sense to be terraforming 
a lot with this Corporation right okay gotcha   yeah so for those of you who are joining us I am 
very much a beginner and so the the point of doing   these videos today is for boneless to teach me 
if you enjoy board game strategy and you haven't   subscribed to our Channel yet please consider 
stabbing the Subscribe button now so wonderful   okay so there's two main strategies in the game we 
talked about this in our strategy guide uh we'll   go over the what you call the greedy strategy 
or the engine building strategy in another video   um but one one thing you talked about was if you 
want to slow a player down or slow the end game   down that you hold back on one of the three end 
game requirements well this this game's already at   Ford nine oceans um so you know is there any way 
someone could stop you from trying to rush this   game well first of all the ocean's not going to 
be a problem because one of the other guys already   played aquafile pumping so I've no doubt the ocean 
is going to be close soon I'm not so worried about   the temperature either because I I can at least 
do one TR every generation with my steel works   um so so it's about the Heat and when we talk 
about the heat there's one card in my opening   hand I regret not getting it gives me like 
one water and three heat and then I go down   to make acrylic production I'm not a big 
fan of this card in general because it's a   little bit rough to start the game going 
down until you make a credit production   but right looking back at it when this game 
is it's a lot about the heat closing out uh   when when is that gonna happen so so with 
this in mind I think maybe I should have   hit this card but I think the reason I did it 
is like this is because I I knew that I I just   calculated adjust barely enough to to to play the 
cards I wanted I want the steel works I wanted the   um nucleosone and I could only do this if I didn't 
keep this card and if I didn't keep this other   Prelude but it's it's kind of rough I I guess the 
um I got one free uh heat production out of the   um nuclear zone so it's a it's a bit of a tough 
choice maybe maybe it's not so bad what I did but   okay now tell me about your thought process here I 
think for as a new player it's overwhelming to see   you know there's over 200 cards in the game 
or I don't know how many there are tons and   just seen all the possible variations that's for 
you probably the fun part because you know what   they all do you know the synergies but as a new 
player how are you guiding what you choose here um okay so you you chose trees I think there as 
and do you generally only just choose one card   uh or two cards or how many do you buy because it 
costs three uh major credits each right so what's   what's the balance there mathematically I'm a bit 
greater if I'm going for the long game I tend to   keep more cards get more card grow and stuff like 
this in this game I'm just uh all right this is a   four player game um only I have I have a lot of 
terraforming going I could probably end the game   pretty pretty early so um I'm Not Gonna Keep so 
many cards actually you'll see that I I might even   end up keeping a little bit too many cards but 
we'll we'll get back to that but the generally   speaking what I just want to close the game as 
soon as possible it's it makes a lot of sense to   not the buy so many cards okay the Subterranean 
Reservoir yeah I mean I I don't really have to   because one guy has the water is almost closed 
anyway so I think this is one of the cards that   I probably shouldn't have bought I think I ended 
up selling this once again that's okay I killed   farming that's that's the like the best car I 
can get right now because there's it's so early   in the game and there's already six water so this 
is really good and here's another questionable uh   idea it's it's kind of funny actually I I end 
up going for physics complex here and the idea   is that I I I'm anticipating that the oxygen is 
gonna be closed sooner rather than later and then   I'm gonna have like already in my hand I have 
enough cards to actually fulfill the six energy   that this physics complex require so my idea 
is that I can close the oxygen pretty soon I   got the Kilt farming and I got the steel works 
and then after that I can get like maybe two   generations worth of physics complex so that's 
like four points fix the complex could give me   so this is where my head is at but the I'm not 
sure it's a good idea because if I do if I don't   actually use six energy on uh one of these science 
resources then this would be six entity that gets   transferred to heat and yeah heat is gonna be the 
last one to close so I'm not sure I made the right   call I think it's a little bit too greedy okay 
well if anyone's played a lot of terraforming   Mars out there I'm sure they'll let us know down 
in the comments yeah but it's uh sometimes you   just want to go all in on terraforming and this 
is what I maybe should have done there but also   um actually Jacob flexilios pointed this out to 
me the other day that sometimes it's also good to   just do this uh his go-to strategy is actually 
to do like a middle middle road so he's going   for terraforming and he's going for some cards 
but not too much card drawn then he's like just   want to close the game a little bit uh before the 
greedy guys is gonna overtake him so so his go-to   strategy is actually a little bit in the middle 
of the road so uh just keep the pressure on but   uh give yourself time to outperform everybody 
else with your engine building in a small way   yeah I think I think this is what um what I'm 
like going for here I'm still getting a little   bit of TR and as you will see I also randomly 
picked up this card in my hand that requires a   jogian tag so in order to actually get three 
energy and three heat what's it called being   from a mass asteroid or something right so it's 
a little bit awkward because my thought was   actually just to go all in on terraforming 
just close the game as soon as possible   um but the the cards I end up giving getting 
is like I'm kind of being not forced but I'm   I'm being inclined to actually go for a little 
bit of terraforming as well or a little bit of   VP as well so for instance now I kind of have to 
play another jobian if I want to play this card   but maybe I'm not maybe I'm gonna sell this car 
if I get some more energy production another way   so that's a lot of things to consider to be 
honest it's interesting The Invention contest   only two credits there uh for a player like 
you that's fantastic because it gives you three   potential cards to improve your draw with for 
me that's a nightmare because I'm just like oh   no what do I do with these three cards [Music] 
yeah I don't know um I think it's definitely   uh I I play a lot of greedy games so 
for greedy games this is definitely a   perfect card for for it's it's still a good 
card here but I I still think I'm uh I'm   keeping a little bit too many cards here so 
here's also an interesting one large Convoy   um I'm really thinking about keeping this card 
because in the late game if I can get like one   animal card I can give me a lot but here is 
actually uh a jovian that I'm thinking about   getting methane from Titan and once again it's a 
bit of a bit counter intuitive to actually pick up   Joe games when you also just want a terraforming 
Rush the game to an end as soon as possible but   here it makes sense because well it does give me 
a little bit it gives me like two heat to him to   play in production and also in it that enables me 
to play the other driving card because that one   requires me to actually play a job in card before 
I can play this beam of from a thorum asteroid   so if people are pretty new to the game can you 
explain what Jovian is uh jovianist attack on this   card for example and usually it's a when you think 
of Jovian text you think of Jovian amplifiers   which is like the set collection of this game 
so there's like four cards that says you get one   Victory Point per Jovian Tech you have right so so 
in this case you can like get a lot of points from   Jovian tax which is why this usually is something 
you you kind of want to do uh for for if you're   playing the long read again but in this case uh 
like I explained that I had a little bit of of   ulterior motives but uh I guess a game sorry go 
ahead no no you I was just gonna say a game like   this where you're trying to rush it you ideally 
want to close the game out before anybody hits 100   points would that be fair to say yeah for sure 
um I think I'm hoping uh for a 70 Russian game   but I'm thinking uh because of the heat I was 
it's a little bit misleading because the heat   was so high to begin with but now that I look at 
the other players it seems like nobody's actually   going for heat production right so it's more 
realistic it's going to be around a generation   eight I would think I can't remember but that 
would be my guess okay notice actually a really   awkward turn because I think what's Happening 
Here is I'm really playing for this bonus   so I kind of already spent uh my mega credit 
on this uh on this expensive driving card and   now I'm checking out the other players to see how 
much plants they have and how much gold they have   and I think one of the guys probably green has a 
lot of plans so I kind of don't want to actually   use my action because my action the steel Works 
actually gives me one more um oxygen so if I use   this then he's actually just going to get a 
free ticket to get the bonus so I'm I'm slow   pulling a little bit here I'm selling some of 
the the sort of questionable cards I I picked up   and I think what also happened is this a 
turn where I actually played this one card   we just talked about a mentioned contest 
yes it is I just saw and then locked there   and that was a mistake actually because 
what happened is I I forgot about my   my Europa which is like get one TR for three three 
Mega credits I had I hadn't used that one yet   so it's uh I could still slow play I just had to 
sell a little bit one more card and it would have   been fine but right here okay so he's finally 
in a position where he's I think he passed at   this point so um the good thing is I I forced 
him to pass with a lot of plans if I I think I   look at greens sometimes here so now he passed 
before me so now he's not gonna get the bonus   so and he didn't want me to get the bonus 
either so we actually passed with a lot of   plans so now there's a pretty high chance that I 
can pick up this bonus in the Next Generation it   really depends on red because red is going to 
start the next Generation so there's actually   a lot of stuff going on here but the right here 
mainly what I'm doing is I'm gonna spend a lot   of time here all right I I messed up a little 
bit I really want to use this Omni Corporation   um power here so do I really want to sell three 
cards just so I can do that and I think actually   I I end up doing it so uh wow yeah that's a bit 
rough I really noticed two major differences   between you as a more experienced player and me I 
don't use the log very much and the second element   is just tracking what everyone's doing and sort 
of knowing and I guess it's because it's just   it's such a volume of information in this game 
that as an early player I'm not ready to take   on not only my strategy but also three other 
strategies and and how to interact with that so   um tell me about the log um how are you using 
that here I keep seeing you flashing over to that   um I'm just checking out what they're 
doing to get an idea of what strategy   they're going for but mostly right here 
I'm using it a lot to really keep track on   um is someone like getting investment loan I 
think a red plate just before or something like   this I want to see will they get this bonus 
or am I in a good position to get the bonus   um so so the bonus is the the main thing right now 
um for sure that must be a challenge to to figure   out if you're gonna beat them or not because they 
may have some kind of trick up their sleeve there   must be cards in there that allow them to suddenly 
explode you know yeah exactly so now I'm I am   actually selling three cards just so I can use 
this power uh I didn't have to I just I shouldn't   have played invention contest I should have just 
like sold one more card and I would have been fine   so that was it hurts a little bit but I think it's 
the responsible thing to do it hurts a little bit   because I actually sold the card that gives me 
two cards so this uh this is like I would never   do this if I played a long game but but right 
here when I'm trying to close the game early I   think it's it's something that I would consider 
yeah the temperature um doesn't seem to be uh   coming up very quickly I thought it was gonna go 
a lot quicker than this I started the same mistake   as you I was like ah the temperature is probably 
fine but no no it's just because a lot of people   just had a lot of like asteroids and like me for 
example I had this nuclear Zone that also gives   two temperatures so we just had a lot of those 
cards in the beginning and then it just stopped   and which is not what I want because I I have a 
feeling that the one of the other guys maybe two   of them have a have a really greedy money engine 
going on in this game so this guy will beat me if   the game goes long so I like I can't allow that 
so it's it's uh it's a little bit the it's not in   my interest that the temperature stopped moving so 
uh so this is why I'm also one of the reasons I'm   also going for these sort of sub-optimal place 
of playing actually Jovian tags and playing   the beam from a an asteroid that I have in my 
hand so here's a big asteroid and this is like   kind of what I want but this is me doing the math 
here and I think that I only have enough money to   actually pick up one card because I also want to 
play uh being from an asteroid of stuff like this   um in a quick game like this what would be a 
typical income that you're happy with you've got   five right here is that yeah this is fine normal 
yeah basically my my main income comes from my TR   right so right here I have the 34 TR actually left 
five so it's not great but it's not bad either   um and then of course a big a big part of my game 
is this free VP I can get every single generation   so I can get uh or TR rather so I could get 
the actually two TR right because I have the   steel works and I have the Omni so for three Mega 
credits I can just get two tra every generation   that's like the biggest strength of my build in 
this game I think nice yeah and sometimes those   they add up over time those small advantages yeah 
and it's actually yeah yeah uh you were buying the   imported ghg which is uh he producer is that right 
yeah and what what's your reason there because it   seems like they um oh I guess that's just to get 
the the overall temperature up right yeah it's a   little bit late to be honest I would rather play 
something like this a bit earlier but the right   here the the whole premise of me winning the game 
is that the temperature is going to be close so I   have to do whatever I can to just get a smart 
seat production right now that's right yeah so   that's actually a really interesting thing going 
on here it's it's uh so I know that I'm gonna   start the next Generation so my first thought is 
like all right what I want is to play this beam   from an ethereum asteroid and then I can pick up 
the terraforma Milestone and maybe just also the   thermalist at the start of the Next Generation I 
can like abuse this because I'm starting the Next   Generation oh that's cool so there's even a deeper 
layer going on here because what I'm realizing is   that the the oxygen is about to close so even 
though I'm in a good position around the table   right now I I'll start the next Generation there's 
still some stuff here I consider yeah so right   here I'm picking up uh actually the Milestone and 
also thermalists so um I was like you're you're   solidly ahead there yeah I could have done that 
at the start of the Next Generation but the other   layer that I'm talking about is that the oxygen is 
about to close so if I'm not getting something out   of the oxygen at the start of the Next Generation 
I'm I'm not gonna get those TR right there so it's   what I'm losing by doing it like this is I'm 
losing like three heat and three energy because   I'm not playing team from a thorum asteroid this 
generation but what I'm getting is potentially two   um TR on the on the oxygen scale so this is way 
better that's way more important um so so this is   why I'm doing it like this I personally I love 
the idea of the milestones in the awards where   they're sort of nominated and everybody benefits 
from it but I mean you only want to nominate the   ones that you're you're going to win so it's kind 
of neat to divert your income to something that   you know could potentially benefit everybody and 
might actually benefit your opponents more than   you if you misplay it yeah yeah I think this award 
here it only costs eight and um at this point I'm   the only one going for for heat production that's 
right I think I end up like getting second place   in this one but this is like entirely my own fault 
or it's actually a conscious choice that I end up   making because I calculated the last generation 
that I I could actually make another play   um we will talk about that in the last generation 
but there's a lot of math in the last generation   of this game it's uh yeah no kidding so when 
you're you're just doing the math here while   we're we're looking at the card selections 
obviously protected habitat is like the best   one of the best cards I could pick up right 
now because what this does it is allows me to   actually put down the greenery using steel and I 
have a bunch of Steel I have nine steel so this   is perfect and on top of that I can also place 
it in a way so I get one more plan so I can just   make one more Greenery so this is why the play in 
the last generation ended up really um it was a   hit-up play and it really ended up helping me here 
because now I will get the last two available Tira   on the oxygen scale thanks to the choices I made 
in the last generation oh really so that's what   I'm doing right now I'm already got the Milestone 
that's out of the way otherwise if I didn't do it   like this the other guy could have claimed the 
Builder Milestone he was really close to it but   by doing this way playing it safe or or what you 
would call it now I can get the last two um yeah   available here on the oxygen and on top of that I 
get to use my plan so now I'm I'm immune to like   asteroids and stuff like this so this is what's 
really good for me man yeah that oxygen just   blasted out of there I really thought it was going 
to be the final one to close yeah uh it's really   hard to predict sometimes I think the reason I 
thought I I'm about I'm it's probably not going to   be the last one is because I've in just seven or 
eight Generations I'm already like pumping that up   with like seven just because of the steel works so 
uh usually like this it's it's uh it's not gonna   be oxygen that's the last one to close wow you've 
hit 40 points here while everybody else is still   in the 20s yeah that's pretty cool it's a little 
bit misleading still because then you also have   to take into account I only have one VP and if you 
look at like red I think red has like a histasis   and there's a lot of cities in this game so he's 
just gonna right have a bunch of Mega credit   production and probably a lot more VP than me so 
it's uh I feel good at this point but I'm not so   sure I'm gonna win it if I win it it's because 
it's gonna be close at seven or eight Generations   um well if it goes to nine there's a there's a 
good chance that one of the guys could take over   take me over here very cool do you play this 
game socially or is it mostly online uh mostly   socially over the board actually uh yeah but I 
I also played like a lot on the on the app just   for just for uh relax but it's like a perfect 
game when you have your laptop in your bed   and you're like going to sleep I'm just gonna 
take one game before going to sleep it's like   I'm too lazy to actually play this game on my on 
my I'm a tower I'm a big computer but yeah it's a   perfect game for a laptop that's awesome yeah 
it's interesting because uh games like this I   tend to cheat with the opening rules where you 
know instead of drawing two corporations and   choosing one uh when I'm playing with friends 
it'll be just take whoever you want right do   you ever do it that way or do you always stick to 
the rules there I will do a little bit different   actually but mostly when I play with my friends 
we have like a bunch of us on my content and I   have a lot of that stuff so I have like maybe 
40 or 50 corporations so so we have like only   one rule that we do differently and that one 
rule is instead of getting two corporations we   just pick four corporations or with that pick we 
get randomly four corporations and then the first   thing we do is we have to like discount two of 
them immediately so we have two corporations and   then we get to see the rest of our preludes and 
our project cuts um gotcha okay all right here   um if you notice I I just saw AI Central and no 
anti-gravity technology and you might be thinking   oh why didn't I pick up that but the a cute little 
trick you can do you could just go to the awards   and look at the scientists uh instead of actually 
checking everyone out so by doing it this way I   was like all right nobody is actually having any 
science text this game so this is not a problem   um so I'm not even gonna Mass converter I just 
kept that because the two other cards were   unplayable so I'm not actually I'm not gonna keep 
Mass converter and once again Luna beam here uh   I think this is another uh it's a little bit 
greedy I understand why I do it the reasoning   why I keep this card is because it has to um 
heat production into energy production and I did   start the thermalist so it's kind of like a card 
that could help me to to protect this award that   I played but on the other hand it's uh this is 
Generation seven I want this video when generation   eight so it's uh it's not worth it I should have 
rather spent 14 Mega credits just like actually   making one temperature instead of this Luna beam 
okay going to a standard price is this the first   time you've used a standard project yeah it's just 
a the thing is now I have six uh plan production   um so even though the oxygen has been maxed um 
it it I still can get some points from cities   and that's one particular City spot here that 
looks kind of Juicy just between there yeah   yeah you've got it you've got two to start with 
and yeah and the once again this is like a play   that will allow me to get some VP so once 
again if I just want to close the game as   soon as possible this is maybe not the best 
idea but in this case I just if you if you   notice I I didn't really have any good cards I 
could play this generation all of it was like   well my hand was kind of useless so I had like 
two two choices either I could just start making   um what's it called the asteroid standard project 
to actually try to close the game or I could just   get one city here just so I have something to 
place my greeneries because I do have six plant   production six plants so and the other city I 
have up north uh I think I'll I'll end up giving   um maybe a little bit too many points to 
my opponents if I if I plant my my my stuff   there so do you ever buy cards just as a sort of a 
strategic plan not knowing if you'll actually need   them or not but you just want to give yourself 
options down the road or is that just a waste of   money um um are you talking about cops that I will 
maybe play later or maybe that's right where it   caught it cost you three in order to potentially 
you know it's kind of like in poker when you uh   you take out you hope for something down the road 
but you may not get it yeah I'm a gambler at heart   so I've I've been guilty and like especially 
in Greedy games picking up like anti-gravity   technology even though I only have like ball 
science Tags I'm like I'll I'll get the last   three it'll happen it'll happen right yeah doesn't 
happen nah in this game here one of the cards   um that could go into that idea would 
be this physics complex I just played   um because the thing is like if if I didn't do 
this I would have another six energy for the Next   Generation but like I said it is Four Points by 
doing it this generation and then I can also use   the action in this next Generation so I think it's 
still okay it will it will give me like four BP   for this card but it is a card I picked up rather 
early in this game so it's I was definitely not   sure if that was the right way to do it which of 
your uh yeah which of these opponents would you   say is the biggest threat now and why is a person 
cooperation I would say it's red but it's not the   I noticed in this game that he's not playing well 
the other two uh are good players they're like   consistingly slow playing consisting milestones 
and stuff like this right and also consisting   bonuses especially right what he's gonna do he's 
gonna yeah yeah I hate to say this but no he's   not he's not a good player because if I recall 
he's actually gonna help me close the game now   and that's like the opposite of what he should 
be doing um but the other two uh the other two   are pretty good so I think probably green but it's 
hard to say green yeah maybe white in the purple   I can't remember but one of those are probably my 
closest rival what are their main strategies then   um well I think one of them is uh E coli so if you 
look at the map here he already has like a fair   amount of points on the map and if I check them 
out or check them out sometimes you you can you   all you do is just click on your opponents to see 
what they are actually doing do they have a lot of   VP do they have a lot of plan production what what 
are how are they gonna make their point this game   in terms of Milestone and awards I think 
it's pretty even in this game so this is   not really a big consideration I think 
we go each got one uh so I got I got to   watch for sure and and yeah it's pretty much 
a wash and then there's the awards over there   um I'll check them out I'm I'm 100 
certain that I cannot get any of these uh   remaining Awards so I I I'm not even thinking 
about it anymore I just thought all right I   got my thermalist I got my one Milestone 
that's it that's good enough yep you're   just hoping you have enough of a cushion with 
your your VP sir yeah yeah it's your TR and I   think I think I will yeah it's I feel pretty 
good at this point um it's a it's quite okay   so yeah physics complex here doesn't look 
like we're quite gonna finish in gen 8.   uh I think uh if you look at me oh this is like 
I'm I'm not even slow playing oh okay there we   go but someone actually yeah this is what I mean 
well who did this purple Oh I thought it was yeah   actually both purple and green no both purple and 
red actually helped me to to close the game so   they're of course also helping themselves 
they want the TR and stuff but it's uh it's   definitely in my interest that they're 
helping me to close the game like this   but I actually had a plan to I I believe I could 
have closed the game even without their health   because if you notice I haven't even I haven't 
even done anything yet I still have 57 gold so I   was just planning to to maybe spend my eight heat 
and just make a bunch of asteroids yeah you're   waiting to see what they're doing in order to find 
a way to maximize your efficiency then yeah yeah   you could say that so right here it looks a bit 
strange that I'm actually spending uh using an   asteroid instead of oh I'm getting another city 
okay yeah so so this city play it wouldn't have   been possible if my opponents would have actually 
uh prolong the game or if if they hadn't like   turned up the heat like this then there's no way 
I would build the city but right now I have a lot   of making credits left over because they are kind 
of helping me so this is uh this is uh it allows   me to make this play and the city is going 
to be worth maybe three points so it's still   questionable but there's also the fact that it's 
right next to water it's giving me a plant here so   it's not bad at all it's right here oh yeah what 
I was saying before is uh my choices here is now   to close with the heat with the eight heat cubes 
I have where I can close with the asteroid or I   can like hope one of my opponents are closing the 
game or I could um I could just spin my cards but   the what I'm really calculating here I'm gonna 
yeah now I'm looking at the awards here what I'm   really calculating is um if I spent my eight heat 
I will concede my first place on the thermalist   but it might be worth it because what I can do 
instead is I can get this man Groove down plus   the trees and those two by themselves would give 
me enough uh places on the map to actually get   a second place in the landlord so even though I'm 
losing the first place on this on the thermal list   I get to like get more points this way because 
I'm I'm getting a second place in the landlord   so there's a lot of stuff too this is like one 
of the more complicated last Generations I've   had because there's so many upgrades yeah there's 
a juicy place for some Greenery there between two   of your cities right yeah that one I'll give for 
sure um and and with the trees yeah of course I'm   also calculating how many how many plants I 
will need to actually get another Greenery so   right now I could get six plus six so that's one 
more and if I get the trees I can get actually   two more plants in the upcoming generation so 
I kind of want to place both of these cards   but uh right now I'm missing one goal if I do it 
like that okay I think that's uh that's because   there's no place where I can actually uh place the 
uh The Mangrove and get like an adjacency bonus to   water so I'm I'm like missing one gold here and 
it's really awkward so I think what I do I find a   way around this I can't remember but I think what 
I could do yeah now I'm looking at the landlord   you're really struggling to find something 
yeah there's got to be something here yeah and   then of course that's also my my Omni Corporation 
special power so I still haven't used that one yet   okay so we're moving into the end game here 
uh tell me what you're thinking about here   yeah here there's a lot of math going on uh 
like I talked about so uh what I kind of want   to do is I want to play the last two hands 
and my cards in my hand Mangrove and also   trees but I'm beginning to realize I can only 
play one of these and because I also want to   use my omnipower and also want to close the 
game so um if I close the game with my heat   like I said it's uh I'm gonna lose the first 
place on the um on the thermalist but on the   other hand if I do that uh I I will have more 
gold so in this case I can play one of my cards   um so I can get the second place on the landlord 
and it's uh there's a lot of like if I remember   correctly I'm like losing I I just need one more 
goal I needed one more goal to play both of my   cards and I also needed one more gold to play um 
I think one of my cards and 14 to close the game   with a standard project and the three for umni 
so it's a it's it's really close but it comes   back to the few mistakes I made in this game it 
really adds up in the last iteration here I just   needed one or two more gold than I could have made 
a better play but it's uh oh that's that's painful   yeah that's a little bit painful so right now what 
I'm debating is should I go for Mangrove or should   I go for trees and I think it's like guitar shop 
I think both of them is going to give me one point   on the card well both of them is gonna give me 
one point on the uh additional Greenery I can   make actually two points if I so I think I do go 
for trees yeah just because the trees can actually   go next to my city so so that would be the only 
difference between those two cards at this point   um because I I just calculate how 
many planes I need to to make an extra   Greenery index around so I'm still like thinking 
about should I really forfeit this first place in   order to play trees and I I'm giving up like what 
is three points but then I'm I'm also getting some   points back to get the I'm getting two points 
from the landlord and then I uh of course the   play itself the green array can make here is like 
worth two points and also there's one point on the   card so when you put all of this math together 
it's a little bit better just to close the game   using the the last Heat the last eight Heat yeah 
I'm looking at people's heat production and stuff   like this right now I'm at 15 in thermalist 
and the other guys at 14 because like I said   he's uh he's uh unfortunately the other two are 
good but this guy is not that good but uh maybe   he forgot about the thermalist because I believe 
he actually spent some heat at this generation   so that's a bad on his part because not only 
is he helping me to close the game but he's   also like giving me the thermalist well hopefully 
he can watch this video and destroy you next time   around yeah probably no he wouldn't need to to 
watch this video to do that he's probably fine   um and also yeah so the thing is with the if I 
give up this uh this this the thermalist I think   did I do it now no not yet I'm still looking 
at the other guys like I must am I then gonna   get the second place on thermalist if I spent the 
date heat or what's happening here right I noticed   you didn't use standard projects very much at all 
no it's uh I think uh if the other players didn't   actually terraform so much heat in in heat in 
this lapse generation I definitely would have I   had like 57 Mega credits or something and I think 
all of those were like dedicated to actually just   pumping asteroids in the last generation right 
if they hadn't helped me so my plan was to just   actually close the game with standard project 
asteroids just because it's very important for   me my cards are bad and my like strategy is 
to close the game here at eight or as soon as   possible it ended up being eight because of the 
the lack of heat production around the table and   because of my own choices I also went a little 
bit greedy picked up some some VP along the way   um Jenny looks like it's going to be a done deal 
here right so yeah for sure and now I am using   my my eight heat to actually close the game so 
I'm forfeiting the thermalist but like I said   it's worth it because it allows me to play 
trees which allows me to get a second place   on the landlord so that's a lot of this this was 
really complicated this last generation actually   it's funny yeah what's the shortest game 
you've ever played in terms of uh generation   I think generation six it's a it's the 
shortest I've played yeah okay in the longest   or the longest uh I think only only for the memes 
I've had like one game go to 15 but other than   that I've had quite a few games to go to 14 if 
I like both me it's only two player games to be   fair but if me and the other guy is like having a 
lot of fun with like our greedy engines and stuff   it can go to 14 but it doesn't happen very often 
okay so this is definitely on the low end yeah   but the in five player games uh it was it was in a 
tournament actually I played in real life it went   to only sixth generation I was like it's almost 
not no fun because it feels like it's very random   who's gonna win these Ultra short games it's like 
you don't really have a lot of lot to say because   you can't really of course there's a lot of things 
you can do to to maximize your chances but it's a   when it only goes to five or six 
or or maybe Seven Generations it's   it's a little bit more out of your hands 
if that makes sense right yeah [Music]   it's always tense oh that's it solid finish there 
yeah so green was my closest rival yeah okay yeah   it actually with all of the uh the greenerycats 
yeah yeah yeah so the big three parties he's he's   getting seven points on me but I'm still beating 
him because I'm so far ahead and terraforming   rating yeah and Greener recent cities is pretty 
close it's uh I was not no yeah yeah I guess yeah   it's pretty close wow purple really didn't care 
about the greenery [Music] no it's uh but the   I think red could have had a very good chance of 
playing this game if he'd been more experienced   because he was playing classes and there was like 
a lot of a lot of cities being made in this game   and he should have more uh he had like what did he 
have to did you only get like two victory points   for cities and three for greeneries this is right 
it seemed like insane for a thousand player that   is right yep two for City three for Greenery yep 
yeah oh well yeah it's a you know maybe he's just   having having some fun maybe he's distracting 
watching TV I'm not gonna be too hard on him but   he was he was playing for the awards he got seven 
there so yeah that's true yeah so he he comes with   lots of metals and ribbons so that's great well 
thank you so much for the run through appreciate   that and we will check out your 279 uh point 
game which will uh show how to build an engine   so thank you so much for your time a problem 
remember get out there get gaming be legendary [Music]
