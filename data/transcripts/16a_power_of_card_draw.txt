Hello and welcome to episode 16 of my terraforming 
Mars strategy guide today we're going to look at   a game I played on the mars app where I went 
for the card strategy and this game is quite   insane mainly my opening hand is completely 
insane but I'm going to show you so I actually   already cropped this replay down and I realized I 
cropped it a little bit too aggressively maybe so   what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pause sometimes 
when there's an interesting choice I have to   make so I got teractor or Credicor I'm gonna go 
for teractor and the reason I go for teractor in   this game is that I have a couple of Earth tags 
in my opening hand I don't really have a lot of   cards that cost 20 plus here when it comes to 
the preludes these are not the best but I'm   gonna choose the 2 Preludes that actually has 
a science tag on it and the whole reason is I   want to play AI Central in the first generation 
so this is definitely one of the best opening   hands I've ever had I talked about this open hand 
a lot in episode three the card strategy but the   whole reason this opening hand is insane is that 
I can play AI Central in the first generation and   on top of that I have two Earth tag Mega credit 
amplifiers I got Miranda Resort and I think I have   cartel and I have a couple of other earth tags 
so this hand is amazing and just a cherry on top   Olympus conference is like the best card in the 
game when you're going for the card strategy and   then I have a mass converter I don't quite have 
five science tags yet but I have four so I just   need to pick up one more science tag so I can play 
Mass converter and then my hand is wow perfect   yeah bio lab to be honest these are not the 
most interesting preludes but they do come   with bit of cards like the plant production 
I don't really care about at this point but   it's it's just for the science tag AI Central 
in the first generation yeah it's so good man so I hope this video doesn't go too fast because 
I did realize what I watched this I cropped it a   little bit too much so sabotage here I just use it 
because I I already calculated that I could play   my hand even after playing it and worth noting 
that's one of the free cards I got is a sabotage [Music]   Luna beam from an asteroid oh that's 
interesting that's only because it has   an earth tag so so I'm setting myself up to for 
better cartel but I actually kept another energy   production card in my opening hand I just 
ended up not needing it because when I have   a energy production on an earth tag that's 
obviously a little better for me right now   and that's pretty much it AI Central 
first generation all I wanted [Music]   second generation Algae I don't know no 
this looks good to be honest ghg Factories   this is actually really interesting I'm 
gonna pause here in a second because uh   so I'm gonna pause here so we have up to four 
cards and when I played this I'm like all right   all of the cards look like trash that's not 
what I want right now so you won't believe it   but this is one of the most important decisions 
of this game so I'm looking at these four cards   that doesn't look that interesting to me however 
there is ghg Factories and insulation so if you   add ghg factories to the two heat production I 
already have that's six heat production that I   can make into Mega credit production so when you 
calculate in the cost of the card is like 19 gold   just to get these six Mega credit production so 
remember really thinking about this and I'm like   ah screw this man I still have some Earth tags 
in my hand I want to play I have the Earth tag   amplifiers I have so much card draw I should 
be able to get some better engine than this   but the thing is I really don't so so looking 
back the correct decision here is actually to   keep ght factories insulation and play this and 
then in the Next Generation then I'm probably   gonna play all the Earth tag amplifiers that 
probably would have been a play but the thing   is I have so many earth tags and I have like 
Earth tag amplifiers and I'm now I'm going   to draw two cards and then I'm going to draw 
another card with business Network and I have   a lot of stuff going for me so I think it's 
the right decision to not go for these like   kind of sub-optimal Mega credit production 
cards when I have so much stuff in my hand   but it's hard to say because the thing is in this 
game I have everything I have all the card draw I   want I have got some nice quality cards but the 
one thing I don't have is Mega credit production   my mega credit production is really gonna struggle 
so right here I get five plus five for the two uh   for the Earth tags so that's that's that's good 
enough I mean my start here I can't complain the   start is completely insane it's very perfect but 
from here on out out now I I played my two Earth   amplifiers so I got like I think 10 mega credit 
(prod.) out of these two cards that's fine but   from now on I'm really struggling to get more 
Mega credit production and as we talked about   already you both need mega credit production 
and card draw this game has card draw all over   the place but I'm really struggling with mega 
credit production and money income in general   that was really interesting so I think a lot of 
people are like I lost a game of terraforming   mars my opponent has more Mega credit production 
what can I do NO I game of Terraforming Mars is   about so much more than just getting Mega 
credit production this play this game here   is like the perfect example so even though 
I don't get out much make credit production   I'm still gonna Crush my score was gonna be 
insane especially considering that it's gonna   be a three player game and and it's only gonna 
be I believe 10 or 11 Generations or something   so so everything is just working out for me but 
I'm just saying that if I had more Mega credit   production to go with this insane starting hand 
then I could definitely edit like I don't know 200   even though it's a three player 11 generation 
game which is good which is good usually two   two player games can generate more than 200 
especially if they go to like 14 or something   but 11 generations for three players then my 
score is gonna be absolutely fine here so I'm   keeping a couple of good late game cards here 
like this um a plant per City card I just kept   yeah looking at Milestones uh once again we are 
at generation three so it's not like I'm gonna   pick them up right now but it is a three player 
game and I think I feel like I'm ahead of this   point yeah so here I'm definitely looking at 
the Milestone so this guy has the specialist   but I'm thinking well maybe I mean if he wants it 
he can claim at the start of the Next Generation   because he's actually gonna start the next 
Generation so I'm just gonna focus on my own game   so I'm gonna sell a card here because that's just 
what I need in order to play immigration shuttles   so this is one of the cases even though I have 
like a the city card that reduces cards by one   it's actually better for me to get the immigration 
shuttles down because even though I could have   gotten that for one cheaper Next Generation the 
fact that I played it now means I have five more   gold Next Generation so that's more than one 
gold so some really interesting cards here   I'm looking at inventors guild the medical lab 
I think medical lab would be great if I have a   lot of building tags especially considering 
that my mega credit production could be a   little bit better I mean honestly most of the 
time when you're going for the card strategy is   something like Inventor's guild would be really 
good but like I said in this game I have a lot   of card draw and I have very little Mega credit 
production so I think maybe medical lab could   be an idea here but I don't know how many tags 
I have maybe I'll check that I'm gonna go for   Inventor's Guild okay makes sense anti-gravity 
holy poop it's not even close yeah let's go   so now now the game has changed and now Mohole 
area I don't care about this I think maybe yeah   yeah so industrial Center I'm keeping because 
I can get a little bit of value on this and I   think it's also because of one of the Milestones 
if I remember correctly but now I have research   outposts I have anti-gravity and to be honest oh 
he actually let me get that one okay yeah well if   if it doesn't want the Milestone then I obviously 
I have to take it and I got IO mining Industries   but at this point I have so much stuff I want to 
play that I can't really play IO Mining Industries   so industrial Center this is also because of 
a milestone otherwise I would have played this   later like it would have been more efficient 
to play after anti-gravity technology but this   is definitely because of the other Milestone 
I think yeah yeah now I'm getting I'm steel   production that's all right that's because of the 
generalist so the thing is I know I'm gonna start   the next Generation so this is why this is um you 
could even debate if it's still worth it but it's   when all is said and done is still a good play 
because now I can start this generation here   I'm gonna pause again yeah because I can start 
this generation by claiming this Milestone I just   achieved because I I know that I can do this 
because I'm gonna be first player so there's   nothing they can do to stop me so here we got 
commercial District large Convoy to be honest   with all the stuff I have in my hand is it really 
worth it to go for commercial District that's also   an argument to be made for large Convoy I think 
the thing is is that I just feel like I don't have   enough Mega credit production so I really to get 
the dream game I really need to get my engine up   and running so it's maybe also a bit greedy to to 
keep large convert just because this card can give   me like seven Victory Points in the late game so 
it's a tough choice these are definitely the two   cards I should be looking for here I'm gonna go 
for a commercial District it's okay it makes sense and then I'm gonna go for hackers I'm not so sure 
about hackers man but and here the last two are   not important I'm not even sure I'm going to keep 
hackers yeah okay so maybe I've just kept hackers   so just so nobody's gonna use it on me that might 
actually have been been one of this I don't even   think I have the energy production to do it so 
so yeah and I'm gonna take generalists then I'm   gonna draw two cards it's only the generalist it's 
only the the one thing where I really wanted to do   it at the first action and now somebody's 
taking the bonuses and the heat whatever   Gene repair I mean it's still good yeah so 
research Outpost so this is because it has a   science tag makes all my cards cheaper definitely 
what I want right now I think I'm going for the   steel down here because this steel can be used for 
some other card that I have in my hand oh I'm even   looking at the last Milestone it would be funny 
if I get all 3 I can't remember but let's see Development Center Mars University of course 
yeah yeah so now we're in this phase of the   game where because I have this card uh what are 
we cloud seeding maybe yeah because I have this   card I kind of need to also have bad cards in 
my hand just so I can cycle so look at this all   of this I'm gonna cycle now search for life is 
not great but is there some other cards that's   even worse it could be windmills yeah it takes 
a long time before windmills makes any sense so and then what I'm looking for 
now is like the last Milestone   and also the anti-gravity technology if I 
haven't played it I don't believe I have   so let's see here space elevator it's a pretty 
clear cut oh mining right I'm actually thinking   about mining right but space elevator makes a 
lot of sense fish looks good Land Claim really?   this Land Claim I think it's just 
so my opponent doesn't grief me   and then I got a jovian Tag that's fine yeah this 
looks alright you could have made the argument   that I should have kept one more card just so I 
have something to cycle with but it is what it is so I'm going to draw some cards 
I wonder what the last Milestone   is here I think I could be in 
contention to to do something   but then again even if I can claim the Milestone 
I also have anti-gravity technology here   yeah so this is what I mean release of inert 
gasses is not a great card but it's not a bad   card either so maybe I should have kept one more 
card just so I had some trash to cycle because   this card is actually kind of okay especially 
considering that it's three cheaper than normal   I think actually I'm gonna pause here because I 
think this is why I didn't go for the Milestone   because I think I planned it out of my head 
that I want to play anti-gravity technology   and then I'll just have barely enough resources 
to play space elevator afterwards it could even   be the case that the reason it didn't pick up 
a bad card in the drafting phase is because I   already did the math and I thought all right will 
this generation just want to play anti-gravity   the I want to play Space elevator I think this is 
maybe what it is so right now of course I'm paying   with 3 titanium but I'm not paying with the steel 
because I need this deal for the action afterwards   and to be honest like milestones and everything 
it's good and all but this generation is still   amazing like if you play anti-gravity plus space 
elevator whatever man you can have the milestones   at this point oh Hired Raiders I believe this is a 
card I just picked up randomly with with something   might as well just grief Saturn Systems a 
little bit it's free for me so so why not yeah and at this point I'm thinking all right 
these guys are actually terraforming a lot which   is annoying I don't really want them to terraform 
that much because I know that I have the dream   game I know that I'm gonna win definitely the long 
game so it's a little bit annoying there so keen   on ending the game but it is what it is Aquired 
companies it's a little bit late generation six   but it only costs four so of course why not and 
then this card is free so this is like when I say   talk about God mode and stuff look at all these 
cheap plays I have available to me here man and   it's only going to get better at this point so 
uh all of these cards cost like zeros or ones   or it's just very efficient to just play all of 
these cheap cards it's really The Snowball Effect   this one yeah I guess it's free I don't like 
this card Micro Mills so much but it is free   so it makes sense you could make the argument 
that I should have uh because now I need to card   to cycle so I I cycled some energy production 
instead but I could have also cycled windmills   and it would have been fine but I guess I don't 
need the energy production so maybe it's okay   so here I think bushes maybe but I think I'm gonna 
go for a Great Escarpment Consortium uh to grief   my opponent a little bit maybe just because it 
only costs three I'm gonna go for Comet and then   colonizer training camp is the last generation 
where I can play that so that kind of works out   so I guess I'm just I'm just hoping that my 
opponent Dzelson the purple guy is not actually   gonna gonna terraform oxygen but we're close to 
bonus I'm calculating that he is probably not   so I'm not actually going to take the uh space 
event cards which is interesting okay Tycoon yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure so I'm definitely 
a tycoon I need to do that as soon as possible   and then all right training camp as soon as 
possible because now it's at 6 so if I'd waited   before doing that then I couldn't have actually 
played a card [Music] another thing all right I   just top-decked Earth Catapult why the hell 
not so I gotta be honest I'm like all right   I only have 15 Mega credit production it's it's 
kind of unlucky only one steal only two titanium   and stuff but when everything is said and done I 
have a million cards and now I have five discount   of all cards so so this is why this game is still 
insane despite the fact that I don't have to Mega   credit production so this is also the point I made 
before that even though you don't have mega credit   production you can still go GODMODE you can still 
have an amazing game it's not about it's not about   Mega credit production this game it's about so 
many different things so many synergies and stuff   so I think this guy yeah he left and now he comes 
back and he's confused I think he just re-logged   because of a bug or something but uh yeah now 
he's now his name changed back so all right so definitely a thing I could have maybe looked 
for here is the bonus that's definitely what   should be on my mind right now the bonus on 
the oxygen scale which is one temperature do   I have any ways of contesting that with nine Mega 
credits I need like two gold uh it's kind of rough   but I think my my idea is that I can't 
really do anything if they if they do   it now okay they'll do it now that 
sucks but in the next Generation I   would have started so I still had 
a chance of getting it actually yeah I'm looking at this I'm like 
oh screw it they got it it happens   now I'm getting some more cheap cards why not 
I still haven't played IO Mining Industries   and I think it's kind of correct because I had so 
much other stuff in my hand I wanted to play but   at this point I think IO mining Industries 
is definitely a card I should be looking for   uh to play in the near future I 
think that would make a lot of sense and oh this is nice but I also noticed that 
I have this annoying search for Life card   I don't know man I've never actually 
hit this in my life it never happened   I like the card because it's a 
cheap science tag and stuff but the   I might I might not even use the active 
because I'm never lucky I never get it um yeah I picked up security 
fleet not bad at this point   we are reaching the uh actually we're kind 
of reaching the end game pretty fast which is   annoying for me but I mean I'm still not that I'm 
gonna win it there's no uh question at this point   yeah so I'm selling a card so I can play imported 
hydrogen and I believe uh the reason for this is I   can place it here so I get two plants plus three 
plants so that's enough to make a Greenery and I   think uh definitely it's also because I'm waiting 
for my opponents to pass the generation because   then I will feel confident to just grab this bonus 
actually I'm pretty sure they have passed at this   point otherwise I would have grabbed the bonus 
before so even though I didn't get the oxygen   um bonus then I'm still getting this water bonus 
which is nice so all of a sudden we have three   Waters placed which is not in my interest I want 
the game to drag out long but you know this was   just such an efficient play that I kinda had to 
go for it and honestly every time you can get a   bonus even though you're going for the long game 
it's probably still worth it and it looks like oh   Kelp farming nice and it looks like it's gonna 
be unless it was search for life was it oh man   it looks like it's gonna be water that's the 
last uh parameters to close the game business   Network looks amazing here yeah now I'm looking 
at the awards I think that makes a lot of sense   this is the time of the game where definitely the 
first of all it should kind of be claimed already   but it's not for some reason Capital looks cool 
Capital looks really cool oh and this one this   is an interesting one standard technology or 
the plant tag Plantation I think Plantation is   better because I have like insects and stuff but 
both of these cards are really good at this point   I have Viral Enhancers I have insects I think 
Plantation is better also because I'm not sure   how many standard projects I'm actually gonna 
end up making because I have so many cards   so definitely the right choice so this looks 
like a capital to me no I'm not going to play   Capital isn't that a really good oh poop oh I 
remember this so yeah I'm annoyed now because I   don't think capital and then I'm like all right I 
don't know what to do so I'm just gonna pass along   my turn and then this guy like my opponents are 
like closing the Heat and I'm left with 10 heat   resources so I'm actually really salty that I 
didn't just start the generation placing Heat   but I guess my mind was on this Capital this 
is a yeah yeah this is a good place for Capital um the five Mega credit production is a little 
bit late but I don't know I think it's still   worth it for the three points that gives me plus 
it is the late game I kind of need just a little   bit of of presence on the map a little bit of 
City synergy and now we get to all the green   tags so in the previous generations I didn't 
I wanted to play all of these cards but I had   some other stuff that was also important but 
now it's definitely all about getting all the   green tags out and playing insects insects is 
definitely what I'm looking for this generation Ecological Zone yeah it's fine also play into 
the award by placing it here and this is what   I mean just by playing this card and before that 
I played um what's it called viral enhancers so   this alone is a good play and then we got all 
this stuff and look how cheap it is and then   I'm gonna get Moss and I'm gonna get Insects 
and all of a sudden these cities I played here   especially the capital all of a sudden this is 
like uh it's gonna become a lot better because   I'm gonna really catch up in plant production 
now for the last couple of generations maybe it   only goes to ten it doesn't look like it's 
gonna go this long this game wow [Music] so now I'm at 20 Mega credit 
production it's a bit better   but it's still not considering how much 
stuff I had is still not great oh man   so satellites I think is still worth it I have 
five space tags I can get a few more immigrant   City I mean I'm obviously taking the Jovian 
Amplifier but the other one could have been   immigrant City just so I could get a cheap City 
in the last generation or something but nah I   can play I can play this for three and all of 
a sudden I go from 20 to 26 so it's not like   a big deal to be honest we're still late in 
the game but it is something so at this point   um I'm finally where I want to be with the mega 
credit production I mean the more the better but   this is interesting soil Factory Earth office 
normally I would think about Earth's office but   I don't think I have any Earth tags so yea 
Soil Factory does for the one point I think   would make a little more sense here yeah 
oh mineral deposit yeah sure you you never   say no to just getting free steel especially 
when you could use it it's it's really good   make sense grass Heather I think maybe Heather 
yeah because it just cost one so it's really cheap   the annoying thing about this game normally 
when I go God mode is like I have a ton of   Mega credits I have a ton of cards I could just 
do whatever the hell I want in this game it's a   little bit different because I kinda have to 
restrict myself to making optimal plays based   on the fact that I don't have so much Mega credit 
production so that's stuff like keeping Heather   that would make sense yeah and now I don't want 
to repeat my mistakes so now I'm just playing two   greeneries as soon as possible so I can actually 
get the last available TR on the oxygen scale so   I don't want to repeat my previous mistake of not 
getting the last three available TR on the heat so   yeah I mean Mineral Deposit for zero 
why the hell not makes a lot of sense   and then we're got Noctis city yeah I think 
on this map I can place it via normal City   Rules so this makes a lot of sense also so now 
my Empire is pretty much set I don't think I   want to build more cities I don't think I have 
the plant production to actually support more   than I have now I think this is fine so now I 
really just want to play the rest of my cards   figure out how many generations are left the good 
thing about being in my position here is that I   definitely know that the opponents is like gonna 
pass the generation before I do because I have so   many actions I have so many cards I have so much 
stuff I can do so I'm always gonna do if this is   the generation we're gonna close the game or 
not this is like 1 point for 3 probably fine so the entire game is in my control is what I'm 
trying to say I don't have a problem with them   closing the game now I don't have a problem 
with them closing the game next Generation I   would prefer it if they waited until the 
next Generation because I still have 17   cards in my hand this guy has two cards for 
example and he has Predators that's annoying   yeah he's definitely stealing from me what is he 
stealing some animal with half a point I think and yeah just squeeze the last couple of TR out 
of a card like this it's gonna give me like two   TR I'm assuming because the game is probably 
gonna be over the next Generation this is also   interesting it doesn't actually give me heat but 
it does give me some like 4 plant production so   I must have done the math and figured out that 
this is probably worth it why the hell did I   do this though that's interesting normally 
I would play this in the last generation   oh man that sucks but I think I I played these 
greenhouses before because of insects yeah so it's   still debatable it's like do I think that there's 
gonna be one more City in the Next Generation   if there are two more cities or something then 
this would not have been a good play but I must   have just imagined that there would be only 
one more City in the last generation because   normally I don't think greenhouses is a good 
indicator to play Insects it's it's a normally   Greenhouses is better to just play in the last 
generation usually that gives more plant this way   but at this point these are only minor 
things it doesn't matter that much   selling something why am I selling it 
I could sell this I must have an idea   of playing some sort of oh is it toll Station did 
I just get toll station I mean it cost five how   much it give me seven so I'm like squeezing 
another two Mega credit out of playing this   card actually only one because otherwise I could 
have sold the card so I don't know is it worth   selling cards for this maybe I guess I I didn't 
really have much to do with these cards anyway   so yeah so two points on this card it's fine I'm 
assuming I have some sort of animal worth two   I don't even know if I have actually what 
about the awards here oh my God I still   haven't played IO mining Industries this hurts I 
have three amplifiers in my hand I think this uh   oh lichen this one is interesting this one is 
really interesting because if I remember correctly   I'm gonna be having some issues yeah I'm not sure 
if I keep lichen here yeah [Music] because it's   one of those cards that's like kind of good for 
me but at the same time I have three amplifiers   I want to play so if this is actually the last 
generation I could have just screwed myself by   keeping Lichen So I think this is why I didn't do 
it but it's it's once again these are minor things [Music]   um so definitely oh my God decomposes I would 
have loved to get this a bit early in this game   but still getting it now for free it's fine um it's so hard it's just gonna be the last 
generation oh the deck is reshuffled no it's   actually I think I still want to go to 11 
generation 11 if I can I think my opponents   if they had been I think they probably knew they 
were going to lose so it doesn't really matter but   what they should have done that being said is they 
should have closed the game now or maybe even in   the previous generation because in the last couple 
of generations I'm gonna I'm gonna get so much   but the interesting I can't 
remember if this goes to 10 or 11. if it goes to 11 then obviously I don't want to 
play my amplifiers now but if it only goes to 10   then I still need to have a lot of Mega credit and 
stuff left over so I can play my Jovian Amplifiers   so I think I have so many actions what I should 
have done technically is just take one action   pass turn take one action pass the turn but 
I think I have so many actions and I'm like   ah they're still gonna pass before I do so 
I know if it's gonna be one more generation   so I'm not I'm not wasting time I'm not 
slow playing here that's no point [Music]   so I did start some awards here so are we getting one more generation it would 
be kind of cool if we did I think we are at this   point they still need to make two water I 
don't I don't think they're gonna do that search for Life maybe you know 
not gonna get it frog this cat [Music] and   now they passed I think so now I know there's 
gonna be one more generation so IO mining   Industries I still play this just for the because 
it gives a little bit of engine and because   I might as well uh I have three amplifiers in my 
hand so yeah so now that they passed now I'm fine   making one more water for zero you might have 
been wondering why they might do this earlier   because if I did that earlier then they might 
have actually uh uh just closed the game so I   really have to be careful when I terraform 
especially when I want the game to drag out   and the city and I believe this was a stanard 
City just so I can get some nice placements   for my greeneries here makes sense I'm I 
can't really recognize these Awards here   but I think one of the awards is probably next 
to water estate dealer could that be the case   it's definitely the the cards that cost 20 plus 
that makes sense I'm definitely winning that one   but I wonder what the other 
one is I'm sure I'm not sure inventor's Guild once again it's a 
science tag I have some science synergy   it's okay but it's not it's not really an amazing 
card at this point because it's only gonna give me   like I can use it now and then I can use the Next 
Generation this is trash and then and also worth   noting the cards have been reshuffled so probably 
all the good good cards are gone anyway so but I have some stuff I can do I think 
regolith eaters yeah it's not good enough   but I have a little bit of of this media archives 
is definitely gonna be clutch I'm gonna wait   until the next Generation because I have so many 
events in my hand and maybe my opponent are also   going to play some events so it doesn't really 
make sense to play it now I don't think [Music] yeah we're gonna wait we're 
gonna chill all good [Music]   uh although this sucks man commercial 
District I guess just for the VP yeah   I think that makes sense the 
rest of them are pretty useless   and this card is like a Greenery for 
my opponent yeah there we go Lichen I   knew there was something about this card so I 
just said no to it in the previous generation   because I thought they would be the last and 
now I'm like all right now okay apparently   the last generation wasn't the last I 
could have played in the last generation so it's a celebrity and Desert Settler okay I 
see so it's kind of ironic that I get Lichen   two generations in a row and I should have just 
picked it up in the previous generation but you   know I didn't know if I was gonna I didn't know we 
were gonna go to 11 instead of ten generation so   I can I can defend myself on this one so the 
last award I should really look at this one   so Estate dealer might look interesting what am 
I what am I doing huh I'm getting one more City   what about the last award Boneless no maybe I'm 
not sure I can win it industrialist estate dealer   yeah okay I see I can probably win Estate dealer 
but is it really worth okay I'm going for it   so it's a little bit risky to 
go for a state dealer like this and here is a really interesting choice I 
believe yeah so this Greenery looks ugly but   this is because of the estate dealer because of 
the estate dealer and the thing is you might be   thinking oh I just kept commercial District 
why didn't I put commercial District in in   between those my my opponent's two cities and 
stuff and it might have been better but uh the   thing is I still have this problem of not having 
enough Mega credit so I think I might not even   play commercial District so this is why I just 
wanted to ensure that I get the um the estate   dealer right here right now I think this is 
my reasoning for doing for doing it like this   and at this point I still have amplifiers in 
my hand so the cards have to be really good   if I'm going to consider new cards at this 
point I don't have as much money as I wanted but I don't think there's any 
race right now I I think I'm fine   I spend my plants [Music] and I 
secured the Estate dealer as much   as I can I think the desert settler 
is already mine I think I'm Gucci Birds is really interesting I think I have a is 
maybe it's the case that I don't have an animal   worth one animal per one with one Victory Point 
per animal yet so it could be that I have to play   Birds just so I can get more value out of my last 
few cards that gives me animals could be could be   like this [Music] and also like we talked about 
playing birds in the last generation is just a   way to grief my opponents in this game it I think 
I'd already checked them so it doesn't really do   much oh yeah and here's another reason I have 
Viral enhancers when I have viral enhancers   then Birds is definitely worth it at this point 
because now it's going to give me two points just   for playing it in the last generation it only cost 
me five gold plus three for the card so yeah this   one for example so this one can go on Birds now 
otherwise I wouldn't have had a an animal worth   it would have been a little bit worse because 
then I had to put it on some of the other animal   cards that only gave me like half a point per 
animal so so Birds is actually pretty clutch   it's going to end up giving me four points I 
guess Methane from Titan if I play this card   then I definitely calculated I can also play 
the last Jovian amplifier terraforming Ganymede   and it makes sense there's actually I mean 
look at all these high quality cards in my   hand there's so much stuff I want to play it all 
but I just have to do the math at this point and   look at this Lichen oh man uh yeah I don't think 
I don't think Lichen was the play ironically and also commercial District was not the play 
either I was also too greedy so now I'm actually   selling some cards once again just so I can 
play this important nitrogen is is probably   the best available option right now so I could 
get two more on birds and stuff like this so   Birds end up giving me six point it's pretty 
good can I get a anything else out of my hand it doesn't look like it I can get Lichen 
oh man just for the ecological Zone it   actually ended up giving me one point which is 
funny because I got one more uh animal tag on   on what's it called ecological Zone so there 
are a couple of good cards on my hand still   but all said and done I'm happy with this 
game man it's uh I just know when I see   the starting hand I had on this game it's no 
question this game is going to be amazing so and I think I had most of the stuff I wanted 
I had a lot of good Synergy I had like   the plant production could have been better could 
have been a bit sooner holy hell I only have 40   seconds I just realized this yeah yeah when 
you're going GODMODE on the app even though   you have like no animations going on you know you 
take the fastest animation possible you still have   to wait for animation you still have to think a 
little bit so 45 minute game I think I think this   was a 45 minute game it just goes really quickly 
so get all the Milestones I get all the awards   can't complain and then all the cities all the 
cards in the end is where I'm really making my   points so 168 points is a really good score 
especially considering this is three players   and and and we only went to 11 Generations 
ironically it's still like 100 less than my   best on the Mars app but we are gonna cover that 
in part two so that's gonna be the next video but   that was a two-player game in 14 Generations 
that's how I made like a hundred more points   than this so this game I think was really cool I 
think I just have to show you this one because I   got so much stuff out of my card draw and all my 
synergies so even though I didn't have a lot of   gold I didn't have a lot of money income it 
was still like a really crushing game and I   it's it just speaks to it it's not only about 
Mega credit terraforming mars it's really cool   so thank you so much for watching and see 
you for the next one which is gonna be uh   my high score on the marsup to 278 points 
or something it's gonna be great Cya :D
