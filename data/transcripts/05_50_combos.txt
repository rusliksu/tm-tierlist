Hello welcome back to my Terraforming Mars 
strategy guide Today is a fun one today we're   talking about combos so who doesn't like combos 
combos is a lot of fun to talk about and it's   also kind of nice to know like instinctively 
which combos you should maybe search for in   your own games so put together 50 combos I think 
most of these are really good there are some here   that are a little bit questionable but I'll get to 
that once we get there if you want to see a list   with all the combos I have for you just go to 
the end of this video so yeah let's go so first   of all let's get the city stuff out of the way 
so we got Standard Technology with Tharsis so   this will allow you to buy the standard project 
build a city for 19 Mega credits instead of 25   and then it'll give you like two Mega credit 
production a placement bonus and a few VP this   combo is fine if you're going for cities it's 
nothing amazing but it's okay here's the more   well-known combo immigrant City Plus Tharsis and 
this is for good reason of course because all of   a sudden when you're building a city you get three 
Mega credit production so now if you're building   the standard project it costs 25 then you get 
three back so now it costs 22 and you get like I   said 3 Mega Credit-production but with this combo 
here as opposed to the first one you don't really   have to go for the standard Build-a-city project 
for 25 you can also just have city cards in fact   City cards would be much better if you have it so 
like immigrant cities Tharsis and maybe corporate   stronghold or something that's a really good 
opening and we are talking about combos today but   I mean combos could be like a number of different 
things as soon as you have more city synergetic   cards like these stacked together well you can 
call that a combo but we already talked about   this a lot in episode three so if you want more 
of the city stuff go to episode three but let's   talk some more about standard technology because 
this can be a really strong card and it can combo   with a lot of different things so for instance 
we got standard technology Plus Credicor now you   can make the build a city standard project for 18 
Mega credit and it's kind of good like in the mid   to late game when you're like trying to fill up 
the map with like cities and greeneries that can   be quite strong especially considering that with 
this combo you can also build a Greenery for 16   Mega credits like in the late game and especially 
in the last generation it's really common that   people actually spend 23 Mega credits just to 
get a greenery down so if you could do this for   16 it's really good then we got a fun one standard 
technology plus Thorgate so now you can build the   standard project power plant for five Mega credits 
there's also this really funny combo that if you   also on top of this have power infrastructure then 
all of a sudden you can make one make a credit   production for five Mega credits I played this 
like once or twice and it is so nice that if you   just have mega credits left over in the early game 
or if you just have bad cards then you could just   build a bunch of energy and to turn this energy 
into gold and it's it's actually a lot of fun   but I wouldn't say it's complete the game winning 
it's just it's fine and also like we're gonna talk   about later in this video getting three different 
combo pieces the odds of getting all three in a   game that's very low then we've got Advanced 
Alloys and Phoblog so all of a sudden your   titanium is with five Mega credit per titanium 
and I mean if you really go down this road then   we could also consider Mercurian Alloys and we can 
also consider the Audi policy if you're playing   with turmoil so now we have titanium is worth 
seven Mega credit per titanium and then we kind   of get to this point right where well you need 
this but then you also need titanium production   and then you also need something to play a lot of 
space tags because otherwise you're just gonna be   stuck with a lot of titanium so it is a little bit 
of a stretch to make this work but that being said   it can be really strong actually having like Steel 
and Titanium that's worth a lot this could be like   a huge boost to the engine but a combo that's 
a little more reliable could be this one IO   mining Industries plus Phoblog and the nice thing 
about this one is that the 10 titanium you have to   begin with with Phoblog all of a sudden you can 
use this directly to play IO mining Industries   because that's 40 right and then just need one 
more Mega credit and then you just paid for this   really expensive card and the other kind of cool 
thing about this combo is that it is sort of kind   of 10 mega credit production if you can use the 
titanium throughout the game so it's kind of nice   you're really happy if you see this combo in your 
opening hand it's quite good and once again I mean   we could keep going but if you put an advanced 
Alloys on this it's of course even better then   we've got Arctic algae with the Lakefront Resorts 
Corporation so if you have this then you just need   some more cards and some more stuff that actually 
gives you water and then you're golden then we've   got high tech lab with mass converter it does 
require you to get like another four science tags   but let's say you have this so all of a sudden 
the high-tech lab that's the last Science tag   you actually need to play Mass converter so if 
you have these two combined then you can draw   like six cards every generation and keep one of 
those and that's really strong so basically what   I'm saying is high tech labs really good but it's 
only good if you have a lot of energy production   like for example Mass converter then we got a 
lot of stuff with the Viron cooperation so this   Corporation makes it so you can use action cards 
twice in a generation instead of just once I gotta   be honest in most cases the Viron Corporation is 
not that good because you kind of need one of the   good combos to actually make this cooperation 
worth it so it could be something like this   for example orbital cleanup of course provided 
that you have a lot of science tags could also   be martian rails if there are a lot of cities on 
the map could also be AI Central this is like the   juicy one this is maybe one of the best combos 
you can have with Viron because just getting   four cards every generation that's really strong 
this is actually the combo I had in real life when   I got 280 on on like 11 Generations or something 
so what I had is AI Central plus Viron and then I   also had a bunch of money income so yeah you 
know what's coming if you have a lot of card   draw which this is definitely a lot of card-draw 
and if you couple that with a lot of money income   as well then you are definitely going GODMODE so 
here is also one of the more well-known combos   this is Soletta plus the helion Corporation so 
let's actually talk about this Soletta card for   a second so the card costs three so for 38 you 
get seven mega credit production you can also   use it as heat to get the heat up so it's a little 
bit better but let's say for the sake of argument   that it's seven Mega credit production if that 
is the case then you're actually paying 5.4 Mega   credit just to get one Mega credit production so 
if this is the early game it's still like okay   but if we're getting to the mid to late game it's 
not really that useful to be honest it's kind of   immigration shuttles territory so it's okay but 
it's really not that good but then of course if   you pick this up in the mid to late game likely 
you will also have a lot of discount on Space tags   and stuff like this so it could still be okay 
so I might be hating on this a little bit but   of course that being said I'm also slightly happy 
if I get this combo to begin with it's it's okay   it's kind of nice other heat combos could be some 
of this stuff we talked about this in previous   videos and like we talked about getting exactly 
eight heat production that's kind of worth 8 Mega   Credit-production because it's the same as 1 TR 
per generation so this is kind of good until the   parameter is closed and then it's useless unless 
you have like helion or insulation or caretaker   contract now let's talk about what I think is one 
of the absolute best uses for standard technology   in the game and that is standard Technology plus 
Poseidon because if you watch my previous videos   you'll know that I really enjoy colonies and I 
think colonies are very strong so if you can get   just three discount on all colonies that's just 
an incentive to buy all of them and especially   if you've got Poseidon because then you also 
get one Mega credit production every time a   colony is placed so it's even better in this case 
just simply having standard technology with the   colonies expansion that's enough that's like 
the best use of standard technology at least   in the early game later on it's really good with 
like cities and greeneries but in the early game   honestly this is where it's this simple it's just 
standard technology plus colonies it's fine so   here's the combo I showed you in the first video 
and this game was just so easy honestly I had a   Ecology research plus standard technology plus 
Poseidon Corporation so in my opening hand in   the first few Generations I kept very few cards I 
only kept the really good cards and the reason is   this is all I want this game I just want to build 
a bunch of colonies and then when I have all the   available colonies I just slammed down Ecology 
research it's very fun and it's a very effective   way to just Stomp the game to be honest and other 
Colony combos honestly it could just be a lot of   the stuff you see here I mean synergies and combos 
it's very closely related so it's kind of hard to   say when is it one or the other but here's a combo 
I don't think a lot of people are thinking about   because this is really thinking out of the box on 
this one so we got the polyphemus corporation and   this Corporation it to be honest it's kind of bad 
it's really a bad cooperation but it does give you   a lot of stuff to begin with but then the effect 
of the corporations is negative you like you have   to pay five Mega credits every time you buy a 
card as opposed to normally you only pay three   and this is including the research phase this is 
really terrible so how can you solve this problem   you just play with colonies honestly especially if 
Pluto is available this is perfect because Pluto   draws you a lot of cards and if you're drawing 
cards for free then obviously you don't have   to pay five to actually buy a card but there 
could also just be some of the other stuff you   want do you want Mega credit production build 
a colony on Luna do you want some steel build   a colony on Ceres do you want to close the game 
I don't know really why you would want that with   this Corporation but it could be the case then 
you build a colony on IO and so on so what I'm   trying to say is that even though cards are 
so expensive with this corporation colonies   just solves a lot of that you can like get so many 
different things with colonies so instead of like   using cards to build your engine you just build a 
bunch of colonies then we've got some of the Green   Tag combos like we also mentioned in previous 
episodes so we got ants and Venusian insects   the reason these cards are good is that a microbe 
on this card is worth half a point so if you can   couple this with like Enceladus or something it's 
really good could also be sulphur-eating bacteria   together with Enceladus this is like this this 
combo is actually kind of fun because it's like   your own personal Luna especially considering 
that no one is really going to contest you   they'll only contest you if they themselves have 
a good micro card otherwise you can get Enceladus   all to yourself so it really opens up the door 
for you to get maybe a double Colony or maybe   even a triple colony in Enceladus and that could 
be really strong of course imagine if you have a   triple colony in Luna you basically won the 
game but now you can do it on Enceladus and   maybe people can stop you but maybe they can't so 
it's just a fun combo to keep in mind I use this   sometimes and it feels really good but of course 
this is only if you play with the Venus expansion   and on top of that you also need the Venus scale 
to go to six so it's not that bad but it can be a   little bit annoying especially considering that 
this is more like Mega Credit-production what   you're getting out of this so the fact that the 
Venus scale has to be six before I can actually   get this going is a little bit annoying so more 
realistically especially in the mid to late game   you should really use Enceladus together with ants 
or venusian insects this is probably better for   you then we've got fish plus large Convoy this is 
like a classic but it's a classic for good reason   because all of a sudden large Convoy this card 
itself is like worth seven victory points for you   so normally this is a combo you play in the last 
generation or maybe just before the water actually   closes so you can get the last available TR for 
the water but it's like when you think about it   in this case Large Convoy is like equivalent 
to a Joven amplifier it's quite expensive but   you're getting a lot of stuff you're getting seven 
Victory points in this case you're also getting   like two cards and then the fish card itself it 
also gives you one Victory point so this combo   as a whole is like eight victory points on top of 
whatever fish can get you in future generations   and then we can also throw Miranda into the mix 
as well as other cards or stuff that can just give   you animals so this is why it's really important 
to have at least one animal where the animals   are worth one Victory point per animal and while 
we are at it if you have these combos where you   can get a lot of animals of course if you have 
meat Industries this is even better then we've   got extreme cold fungus if you couple this with 
Regolith Eaters or GHG producing bacteria this is   like one free TR every generation so that's also 
kind of really good so like we talked about this   is also kind of worth like eight Mega credit 
production at least until the parameter closes   when the parameter closes it's really bad again so 
Regolith eaters or GHG producing bacteria I don't   think these cards are very good you really need 
something like extreme cold Fongus to actually   make these cards worth it I think you could also 
use extreme-cold fungus together with Ants or   Venusian Insects to get at least one Victory Point 
per generation and this doesn't stop at any point   this just keeps going until the game is over 
it doesn't matter that the parameter is closed   in this case and instead of extreme cold fungus we 
could also put in this card bactoviral research so   this is also really nice but especially ants and 
venusian insects because this is a card you want   to play in the last generation extreme cold fungus 
together with sulfur eating bacteria or recyclon   also very nice of course then we got this stuff 
Mars University plus Olympus conference and to be   honest it's hard to see if this is just a really 
good combo or if these two cards by themselves   are just excellent but nevertheless when I've 
had these two cards in my game I've literally   never had a bad game the only way that these two 
cards are useless is if you never draw a science   tag after you play these so it could happen but 
I mean in most cases this is just very good the   reason you could call this a combo is that all of 
a sudden the bad science tags well now you just   keep it because it's a science tag because science 
tags does so much for you right now and like we   mentioned in the previous video These two cards 
also get exponentially better if you have more   card draw to go with this so let's say for example 
you have Point Luna and then you have these   two cards as well now you are yeah now you're 
approaching GODMODE territory here is a combo that   just got announced like last week or maybe when 
when this is out maybe two weeks ago or something   this is triple Corporation is now canon man oh 
man this makes me excited so you've got merger   plus double down this means that you can have 
three corporations together in a game you can   play with three corporations at once and that's 
ah man it's fun I like this we kind of already   had this but this is only if we played with 
user made content but now it's canon now you   can actually theoretically happen in a game of 
terraforming Mars it's very unlikely but it could   be a lot of fun to actually play a game with three 
corporations so these combos I just mentioned   these are also combos I'm using in my theorycraft 
opening hand which we talked about in the last   video this is like pure Theory craft but as you 
can imagine having all of this stuff in the same   deck is completely insane and if you couple all of 
this card-draw together with Card discount this is   also very strong you could just say a combo is 
like Card discount Plus Card Draw and that's a   really good combo as well then we've got physics 
complex together with CEO's favorite project of   course also really good normally you play this 
combo in the very last generation of the game why   because first of all you need to actually have 
something on physics complex before I can play   this and also this combo gives you nothing except 
Victory point so that's another reason you want to   play this in the very last generation and finally 
maybe you pick up Earth office or something so the   CEO's favorite project can actually like be 
better to play in the last generation maybe   you'll regret having played it earlier so this 
you just play this in the last generation that's   all I'm saying then we've got physics complex 
together with mass converter it's a little bit the   same story like we talked about with like Hi Tech 
Lab plus Mass converter it's really good if you   can get these together because physics conflict 
is another card that requires you to have a lot   of energy production and also Physics Complex by 
itself also has a science tag so this could just   be the last Science Tag you need in order to 
play Mass converter then I saw on the Facebook   Mars group that someone mentioned this combo said 
is this like the best combo you've ever seen and   yeah it could be if you have literally 12 energy 
production and then you also need maybe even more   energy production if you like using energy to 
trade or something so this is of course still   very good but it does come with a cost like 12 
energy it's actually a high cost that's all I'm   saying then we got one of the really good combos 
robotic Workforce together with either gyropolis   or medical lab this is magnificent if you're 
not lucky enough to get those you can also   use this with strip mine or Mohole area and it's 
definitely good but it's not maybe as good as you   think because like if we take strip mine then all 
of a sudden you have to spend another two energy   production to actually play this and worth noting 
you're not getting the two oxygen when you're   using robotic Workforce on strip mine because 
the two oxygen they are not part of the brown   box if that makes sense and robotic Workforce only 
copies the Box itself Mohole area that's kind of   nice of course getting 4 heat production for 9 
Mega credits that's of course a really good deal   especially if there's a purpose with this heat 
so if you're playing this I'm assuming that you   have a purpose in mind for this heat production 
then let's look at some floater combos so we got   Stratopolis plus Forced Precipitation this reminds 
me a little bit of the micro combos we saw earlier   like with extreme cold fungus together with ghd 
producing bacteria for example so you're getting   one free TR every generation that's kind of good 
that's like eight Mega credit production then you   also have 2 on Stratopolis itself that's 10 so 
this combo here is a little bit more expensive   because of Stratopolis but it's definitely worth 
it because even if the Venus scale is closed   completely then you can start pumping floaters 
on stratopolis itself because the floaters here   are worth one third of a point then we also got 
Stratopolis plus floating Habs this is a little   bit better because the floaters on floating Habs 
is like worth one victory points per two floaters   instead of one per 3 which it is on Stratopolis 
so this combo here is like 1.5 Victory Point per   generation then we've got the really good late 
game combo it's hydrogen to Venus plus floating   habs in the late game this can be like a lot of 
points and with noting this is a space event so   probably you have a lot of discount on events or 
space events or space tags so this does of course   require you to get some jovians for this to be 
good but when you think about it this is like   half of a jovian amplifier for 11 and then you 
have a bunch of discounts so it's kind of good   but it is of course best with floating habs there 
are few other cards that can also hold these Venus   floaters but it's not as good floating Habs is 
definitely the best card for this you can also   use this like in the mid game and just put it on 
something like Forced Precipitation just to get   one free Venus every generation also okay and then 
we got some of the a little bit less impactful   combos I would say these are still good if you 
get them in a game but it's not like broken or   anything so for example we got Floater technology 
plus aerial mappers well this is just like one   free card per generation it's fine it's actually 
literally a sub cross measurement if you think   about it could also be floater Technology plus 
Titan Shuttles in this case Floater technology is   literally a titanium mine it's kind of funny but I 
would argue that Floater technology is even better   than this because this is like combo you could be 
running in the early game but then later on you   can actually use Floater Technology together with 
another floater card so the flexibility of Floater   technology makes this a little bit better than the 
titanium mine in this case Floater technology plus   local shading I mean in the early game this is one 
free Mega credit production every generation and   these cards are pretty cheap fine and basically 
like we talked about you can look at all of these   Floater cards here a lot of these cards put 
together are like combos you know but let's   look at one of the absolute best combos in the 
game I'm talking kelp farming plus ecology expert   so yes this does cost you an entire Prelude and 
20 Mega credits because you actually have to buy   the card and then you have to play kelp farming 
but even this man this is completely worth it   because look at what you're getting you're 
getting 2 Mega credit production and 4 plant   production and then on top of that you get 2 
plants 2 plant tags it was definitely worth   it there's literally no case where I would not 
keep this in my opening hand if you see this in   my opening hand I keep it no questions asked and 
kelp farming is the best one but it could also be   like farming plus ecology experts could also be 
trees plus ecology experts could also be Penguins   plus ecology experts Penguins is probably the best 
animal card you can have but why do I say Penguins   is better than fish in this case and the reason 
is that you really have to think about when is   stuff actually being played so the way you do 
it is first you play all of your corporations   and then you play your Preludes so when you 
play this ecology experts it's very unlikely   that anybody except for yourself actually has a 
plant production at this point because the only   way they have plant production is if they have 
a cooperation with plant production Ecoline or   maybe there's one more I'm not sure if they 
don't have the corporation which is unlikely   then they must have it on a prelude which is just 
as unlikely because generally the preludes with   plant production those are not that strong and 
also it's only the people who are actually before   you like if you're a first player you literally 
cannot steal plant production from someone else's   prelude because you're gonna play your Prelude 
before they play their Prelude so it's very   likely you have to take this plant production from 
yourself and that's a little bit awkward but this   combo has been the subject of a lot of debate so 
I think it's really interesting to talk about so   for example if you also have Viron to go with it 
then all of a sudden you get two animals on your   card every generation so is this good so here's 
a thread I read on Board Game Geek and it's like   an old thread it's from 2019 I'm gonna link it in 
the description so basically what happened is that   this is the first video where I actually wanted to 
do some research online because I thought it would   be a shame to actually forget about a really funny 
or a really good combo so I googled Terraforming   Mars combo and just happened upon this random 
thread on Board Game Geek this guy Scott D   he asked this very interesting question he said 
that a player in my latest game was lucky enough   to draw all of the following during set up fish 
action lets you basically add one Victory Point   per turn Ecology experts Prelude card that lets 
you play a card from hand ignoring fish Global   requirement it gives you the plant production 
fish needs to reduce Viron cooperation that lets   you repeat a single action each turn this combo 
seems massively overpowered if the game goes to   10th Generation that combo is worth 20 victory 
points significantly better than the three to   five victory points you might otherwise be able 
to wiggle out of fish so what is the drawback   to this combo even if you use Viron's ability 
on a different card sometimes you're likely   still looking at roughly 15 victory points in a 10 
generation game something like this it just seems   like a huge gain with next to no downsides at all 
now I'm not hating on this guy Scott D I think his   question is very good and it's very nice that he 
actually started this entire debate around it but   one of the downsides as I see it is the value is 
not really enough it's like okay but it's not like   broken or anything we'll get back to that in just 
a second but the other downside is that it is of   course also very unlikely to actually draw these 
three combo pieces at once but you don't have to   take my word for it instead I refer you to this 
nerd so this guy Trevor Scott he actually answered   this on the board game geek thread so he said 
to put it bluntly the extreme low probability of   drawing it okay so let's see so I'm assuming here 
that you're using all the Venus next and preludes   cards since Viron is a Venus next Corporation and 
ecology expert is obviously a prelude card so I'm   assuming that you include the corporate Era from 
the base set if either of these assumptions are   inaccurate that will obviously change the numbers 
a little bit with base plus colonies expansions   plus Venus next plus Prelude we are talking about 
264 cards 22 corporations and 35 prelude cards   the chance of drawing fish in the opening hand is 
then 10 divided by 264 or 3.79 percent the chance   of drawing Viron as one of your two corporations 
is two divided with 22 that's nine percent the   chance of drawing ecology experts as one of your 
four Prelude cards is 4 divided by 35 so that's   11.43 put all that together chance of drawing 
this combo is 80 out of 203280 or 1 out of 2541   so that's approximately 0.0394 percent I love this 
man people who actually do the math on this as   well oh it's so good so I'm gonna keep going yes 
it's actually a straight up probability like this   because there's no possibility of repeating 
cards feel free to do the math yourself if   you don't believe me I believe you don't worry 
there are some obnoxious powerful combos in the   game no question about it also recycling plus 
extreme cool fungus is an example we actually   talked about that before Unmi plus Spade mirrors 
plus equatorial magnetizer is another almost any   card driven game is going to have them and there's 
really nothing you could do to avoid them except   for further diluting the cardpool but that will 
add more powerful combinations for math purposes   adding colonies into the mix will bring the chance 
of this particular combo or for any combination   of one card one Prelude and one corp to 80 out 
of 332850 or 0.0240 percent that makes no sense   there's a zero there but okay about 40 increase so 
my man Trevor thank you first of all for actually   doing all of this math if anybody appreciates 
math it's me but I just have to make fun of you a   little bit because you just mentioned that getting 
three combo pieces at once is so unlikely and then   immediately you just mentioned that Unmi space 
mirror is equatorial magnetizer is another good   combo and I'm like well that's just as unlikely 
isn't it let's actually talk about the combos he's   talking about here so first of all extreme cold 
fungus plus Recyclon I agree this combo is really   good he mentioned this one then he mentioned space 
mirrors plus Equatorial magnetizer and I just have   to say that this combo by itself is not actually 
that good because what are you really getting   you're getting one TR every generation like 
we've established that's like eight Mega credit   production but you're spending seven so if you put 
some numbers on it and just assume that you spend   three Mega credits to buy these two cards all of 
a sudden you've spent 20 Mega credits just to get   one Mega credit production that's not good the 
combo Trevor here mentioned is that you also have   the Unmi Corporation so if you put all of this 
together it's it's pretty nice I wouldn't say this   is completely broken it's just fine to be honest 
because once again you are paying 20 Mega credits   just to play these two cards and on top of that 
with this combo you're spending 10 mega credits   just to get two TR every generation so that's 
good of course but considering you spend like   20 Mega credits just to get this up and running 
it makes me think that it's okay it's not great   it's not bad it's okay but ladies and gentlemen 
it doesn't stop here I'm introducing to you now   the third nerd maybe the biggest nerd of them all 
so this is Russ so I'm not going to read all of   this you can pause the video and read it yourself 
if you want but basically first of all he's a nice   guy he said here's my quality of analysis of the 
combo sorry for self-reference oh what a nice guy   and basically after he put this combo through his 
math machine then it turned out to be 59 which is   just within the error bars of 60 basically he's 
saying that this is okay he's actually saying the   same as me that this is okay it's not good it's 
not bad it's like a pretty average combo it seems   like this guy Ross knows what he's talking about 
I mean if you're throwing this much math at like a   board game geek thread I have respect for you and 
I'm humbly bowing this guy obviously knows what   he's talking about I think that's pretty much it 
for this video here's a list of all the combos we   looked at today and I just wanted to say I made 
a little bit of fun of these three guys on the   board game geek thread and they're probably not 
watching but if they are I hope you guys are cool   with it and to be perfectly honest I'm very happy 
that you're here I'm really happy that people like   you are starting some good conversations on 
Board Game Geek threads and stuff like this   and it's especially that you're throwing so 
much math at it I mean that's that's awesome   man I really do appreciate that but yeah that's 
pretty much it thank you so much for watching
