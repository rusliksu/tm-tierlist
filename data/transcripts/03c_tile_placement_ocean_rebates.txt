Welcome back to my Terraforming Mars stretegy 
guide today's episode is tiles and ocean rebates   So today we're going to talk about optimal tile 
placements and also we are going to talk about how   to get the maximum efficiency out of your ocean 
rebates or ocean adjacency bonus if you will so   we're going to talk about all three different Maps 
today we're going to start with Elysium then we're   going to move on to Tharsis which is the base map 
and then Hellas and then there are a few other   topics I would like to discuss like how to deny 
enemy rebates and the ocean standard project there   are chapters in the description so for example if 
you only care about the base map which is Tharsis   then you can just go and find that chapter but 
let's start off nice and basic there are two types   of people in this world they're people who love 
plants and then there's also people like Saruman   from Lord of the Rings and I thought I like plants 
and plant-production I think it's really good but   recently I've been spending some time with the top 
ELO players on Steam and these guys they really   love plants so the tempo-players who seek to end 
the game in as few Generations as possible these   guys will just take the three plants and make a 
bunch of greeneries next to Ocean and it's even   better if you can place down the ocean next to 
the three plants as your first action and then   claim this tile as your second action because this 
will give you plus two Mega credits it could also   be the tile right to the left of this one let's 
say both of the oceans and the middle have been   made in that case it makes a lot of sense to just 
place it right there instead on the other hand   the greedy players will be really tempted about 
grabbing these three tasty cards up here and I   know I like to divide it into the greedy playstyle 
and the tempo play style because it just makes a   lot of sense for me but of course you can mix and 
match this however you want like naturally in some   cases the tempo player will also tend to take the 
three cards maybe they just have bad cards at the   beginning of the game and at the same time the 
greedy players might also build in the middle of   the map with all the plants here because it's just 
a really good place to be no matter what style   you're playing and then you might be thinking 
what about this tile up here isn't this tile also   really good I actually had a huge discussion with 
the TEMPO NERDS not too long ago about this so   Inquisitor mentioned this tile in particular and 
said isn't this really good because it's adjacent   to tiles that can give you four four six six back 
in Ocean rebates later in the game once the oceans   have been placed so he's talking about these four 
spots here but then anthracite was like one of   the absolute goats of this game he said well you 
should not calculate the rebates adjacent to the   ocean and not add the value for plants collected 
this area of Elysium isn't even the best area on   Elysium as the two to three plant spots in the 
middle are worth four to six Mega credits by   themselves and of course this is the way to think 
about it like plants are actually really valuable   one plant is worth around two Mega credits some 
of the TEMPO NERDS will even argue with even more   than two Mega credits but just for the sake 
of argument let's say a plant is worth 2 Mega   credits having this in mind we should upgrade 
this tile here so six Mega credits rather than   4 Mega credits so if we apply this logic to the 
middle of the map you can see here that there's   actually a lot of value to be collected here it's 
definitely the best place to be if you're valuing   plants and if you can get the oceans down around 
it because these numbers here they are of course   if you get maximum ocean rebates so what about 
this tile here with the three cards what is this   tile worth so previously I've been saying that 
random card is worth three Mega credits and in   the two player games where you play really greedy 
it's with around 4 Mega credits but there's also   this argument to be made that if you're going all 
in on terraforming if you just want to close the   game really quickly you're playing a Tempo 
game and the cards in your hand are already   fine they're already supporting the strategy then 
a random card is not worth that much to you so in   that case it could be argued that the random Card 
is only worth two Mega credits and that also ties   into the storyline I'm trying to push here that 
generally speaking the cards are just better for   greedy players the thing is if you're playing this 
game where you just want to end the game as soon   as possible then it is a little bit dangerous 
to just pick up too many cards because it kind   of ruins your Tempo so if you go back to the map 
and if you're really pessimistic of card draw in   general and say a random Card is only worth two 
Mega credits well then this tile is kind of like   worth 6 mega credits before we calculate in the 
rebates I think a more average view on how much   a random card is worth is more like three Mega 
credits in that case it's nine and if you are   a completely greedy player and you're playing the 
ultra greedy Über card strategy then in that case   I would still like you that a card is worth 4 Mega 
credit but only in that case but let's stick with   three Mega credits for random card I think most 
people will agree on this but if we are applying   the logic from before that we're just calculating 
in the dream scenario the max ocean rebates we'll   in that case if we place this tile next to the 
two oceans that's already been placed then this   should be 13 right I don't think this tile is 13. 
I think it's still a bit too high and there's a   few different reasons for this first of all these 
two versions We just mentioned here these are   generally not the first oceans to be placed the 
only way these two tiles will actually be placed   as the first oceans is because you yourself are 
placing them because you are intending to grab the   three cards with maximum rebates afterwards and 
while we are at it this tile up here also almost   never gets placed like in general so I feel like 
we have to do a little bit of adjustments here so   with maximum rebates this tile up here is worth 
four but it's not that often that this ocean gets   placed so I think I would I would say it's more 
like two to be honest and I think a fair value   of what this tile with the three cards are worth 
is around nine because like I said is not often   that these two oceans gets placed before somebody 
grabs these three cards here and also you're kind   of restricting Yourself by placing a tile over 
here or like the TEMPO NERDS would say this tile   has a bad portal and don't you worry we're gonna 
talk plenty about portals in a minute but before   we do that let's actually discuss the best oceans 
on this map so as always it depends on the game   but usually these two oceans are the first to be 
made the oceans themselves comes with two plants   on them so that alone is good and also it just 
enables all of these tasty rebate spots around   the little Lake here and technically the six and 
eight to the north east these are not worth this   yet until you place more oceans but this is also 
why that the next oceans that will usually get   placed are these two so you can see the theme here 
these two oceans also come with one plant each and   also you just enable yourself to get this golden 
little landscape here with three eights well based   on this system this tile should be worth five 
but it could be argued that it's worth a lot   more because like Inquisitor was talking about it 
does have some juicy neighbors but the thing is   if I start rewarding some tiles for having good 
neighbors then this is just a rabbit hole from   which I have no idea how to navigate so let's just 
say that this tile is worth five as long as you   know that there's a lot more things to consider 
you also have to consider the good neighboring   tiles you have to consider teleports you have to 
consider which oceans are usually played first and   you also have to consider what are my opponents 
doing this game so is the tile with three cards   any good I think generally yes like it's a greedy 
player myself I'm very tempted to actually grab   these three cards in most games but preferably 
you really want to grab this with a special tile   it could be natural preserved restricted area 
nuclear Zone something like this could also   be the experimental forest Prelude another goat 
called Parker his superhero name is actually Gods   while his secret identity name is Parker he said 
that while there's always exceptions I think the   general too long didn't read of Elysium is don't 
put cities on the three cards it's not worth the   investment generally and any Tempo Rush strat 
should prioritize plants rebates in the middle   or the left of the board over the three cards 
those three cards can get heavily overvalued early   on with people overinvesting to get them so the 
point is if possible you really want to claim the   three cards with a special tile but let's get 
back to portals as you may have guessed the   point is that it's really hard to scratch your 
own back if you don't have a portal actually it's   kind of weird the way I'm phrasing it so that 
yeah probably no way you guessed that actually   the real Point here is that the rules say that you 
must Place Greenery next to a tile that you own if   possible so did I just make this comparison just 
so I had an excuse to show you this Portal meme   that I like about a woman scratching her own back 
maybe the point is it's kind of hard to get back   to the middle of the map once you've committed 
and placed the tile on the edge of the map and   you might be thinking well what's the big deal I 
can just buy a city for 25 as a standard project   to get back into the middle of the map and no you 
really don't want to do that it's very expensive   it's not worth it especially not in the early game 
so if you're thinking all right you're spending   way too much time on this portal stuff it's really 
not that big of a deal but I'm telling you I've   spent some time with these TEMPO NERDS and the 
top three words that they like to say when I talk   to them number three is Portal number two is ocean 
and number one is rebates I'm not kidding and also   a heat production they also love heat Productions 
I actually scratch that new list top four words   amongst the top ranked players on Steam number 
four heat production number three portal number   two ocean number one rebate I'm serious it's like 
catnip to these people they just love to say these   four words so having all of this in mind I think 
these numbers here are fair as long as you keep in   mind that there's no portal on the three cards or 
well I'm saying no portal but it's more like it's   it's kind of a bad portal if that makes sense it 
takes a while to get to the middle so when all   is said and done the middle part of the map is the 
best place to be your can also go for the cards if   you feel greedy but to be honest like I mentioned 
it can also just be the tempo guy who just needs   the card you know anthracide made a good point 
here as well he said that it's important to   understand that these rebates are worth two times 
to face values in two player games as if you don't   capture them yourself your opponent will this 
makes them deceptively powerful swings if you   develop two cash Pro that doesn't cost your 
opponent anything but if you take the three   plants spot not only do you gain three plants your 
opponent loses them so I mean if you want to take   what he says literally then you could actually 
double all the values on these in 2-player games   I don't know it gets a little bit out of control 
you know what I mean it's not quite like this so   the overall values are like this but like I said 
I kind of feel like the right side is a little   bit too strong in this case which is why I would 
like adjust it a little bit so it looks more like   this and speaking of anthracite I showed some of 
my slides to the guys in the Discord group and   Anthracite was like Oh okay that's cool I actually 
had a conversation once upon a time with this guy   StefanF and we like came up with this map here 
so as you can see it's pretty similar which makes   sense when you think about it because Anthracite 
also puts plants to be worth 2 the only difference   really is that on Anthracite and StefanF's map 
it's like cards are worth 4 whereas I put cards   to Be 3 and then the map they have made is like 
the perfect scenarios for all of the tiles so   it's of course what they were going for so I'm 
not blaming them but at the same time it doesn't   really reflect how the tiles should look like I 
think the best example I can give on this map is   that they put the tile with the three cards to be 
worth 16 which is of course way too high and the   reason they put this tile to be 16 is of course 
they just calculated with maximum rebates which   is a little bit unrealistic and also they put a 
random card to be worth four and also they didn't   take into account that this tile has a bad portal 
Der_Maister said I think the evaluation of the   three card spot is very high compared to the other 
spots is right the main issue as you already wrote   is that the bad position that you usually lock 
yourself into if you go there also the Eastern   spots needs a lot of oceans to yield the rebates 
while the center only needs two Central oceans to   unlock a ton of cash if you take three cards you 
usually miss those and thus they're only worth it   if you're really desperate or you have another 
teleport Parker also agreed with this he said   yeah if you have an awful hand and you need cards 
to bail you out of a crappy start maybe cards is   okay if you have a city Prelude plus Tharsis city 
then maybe cards is okay three plants with the   other although even here a city on three plants 
and one left of the oceans seems likely better   getting the three cards is like some biolab 3 
card draw where you can just cripple your start   and board control if those three cards flop so it 
is generally agreed upon that the right side of   the map with the three cards over here those tiles 
should be nerfed a little bit because these tiles   do come with a lot of drawback I think Anthracite 
himself would also agree with this the thing is   he didn't make this map for educational purposes 
it's literally just a conversation he had a long   time ago with this guy StefanF so imagine making 
a map like this just because you're just having a   casual conversation Im telling you guys these guys 
are absolute nerds It's freacking amazing and then   they also made this map here which in anthracite's 
own words is a way to think about city placement   potential stating the rebate value of placing 
a city there and surrounding it with Greeneries   so it's really cool that they also mathed out the 
best places to be if you're building a city and   there's really no surprise that the best place to 
build the city is in the middle of the map so this   tile here is the highest with a value of 36 which 
is no surprise because this is generally agreed   upon that this is the best place to place a city 
then also the tiles right next to it are good we   got 30 in this tile and 30 on this tile then the 
tile Inquisitor was talking about has a value of   28 and apparently the one right next to it is 
29 but I think that's a little bit misleading   because the top left ocean almost never gets 
played and once again these values to the right   side of the map are a little bit too high like we 
talked about generally it's not the best place to   build a city over here so with all of this in 
mind let's look at how especially tempo players   likes to build on this map and you get the idea 
by now they just want to make a bunch of oceans   put a bunch of greeneries next to the oceans and 
just end the game as soon as possible incredibly   boring and then once they've done something like 
this then they might put two oceans over here to   the right and then they might claim the three 
cards with a nuclear zone or something but you   know I'm oversimplifying a little bit I think 
if they have a special are like nuclear Zone   they will probably take the three cards a 
little bit sooner so a typical Tempo game   on the highest level on the mars app for example 
it could really look something like this it's a   little bit oversimplified I think they would 
put in some special tiles to actually block   each other off from rebates and stuff like this 
but aside from that this is pretty much how they   would like to play I even showed this pictures 
to some of the guys in the Discord and they're   like yeah it looks pretty good to me however 
this just looks like a bland salad to be honest   like no cheese no no dressing just a bland salad 
with no joy no enjoyment whatsoever and you might   be thinking there's not even one city here 
there's even a spot here where you could get   three points for City but in these super fast 
tempo games cities are just not that important   I had a YouTube comment on one of my videos by 
Mc Bescheiden who said I don't agree with the   argument that you have to build a city in a game 
why I've had games where I did nothing in Mars and   won by Miles and initially I just said to him 
well for no other reason that plant production   is really strong in this game so having just one 
city is often pretty nice so you have a reliable   way of scoring points with your own greeneries 
next to your cities but I agree with you that   sometimes it's not even necessary to have one city 
but in my experience in most games having at least   one city feels correct so I thought about it some 
more and really to be precise in Greedy games you   should always have at least one city in Tempo 
games however you might only have one city or   maybe no cities at all so that's pretty much what 
I replied to this guy recently I also said to him   having games where you have nothing on Mars at 
all is not recommended as plant production it's   just way too good in this game and I want to make 
this clear plant production is great in literally   every strategy which means that you should have 
at least a few greeneries on the map in literally   every single game we can actually go through 
the strategy real quick to show you what I mean   so in the first strategy refuse to terraform 
yes you're gonna have plant production in the   second strategy where you are the FILTHY DIRTY 
TERRAFORMER obviously you're gonna have plant   production in the third strategy where you go for 
the card strategy where you just want to go for a   long game and make a ton of points yes you're also 
gonna have plant production in this case because   the thing is you're gonna have discount on cards 
you're gonna have a ton of Green Tag Synergy and   also it's just a very nice way to score points 
having a bunch of plant production so plant   production is always good and then strategy 5 and 
6 are pretty much extensions of the card strategy   strategy number five Jovian Tags ah sure let's go 
plant production strategy number six green tags of   course like I mentioned then you're also gonna 
have plant production and finally the mid game   strategy where you don't know yet if you want to 
go for the long game or just terraform like crazy   like no matter what you want plant production 
plant production is always good which means you   should always have some greeneries on the map so 
like I mentioned in tempo games you may only have   one city it could be like here which is the best 
city spot it could also be here or here or here   but you know it really depends on the game could 
also be the case that you want to build a city   here because then you can access all of the plants 
on this side of the map so building Greenery like   this in Greedy games where you really maximize to 
get a lot of VP and go for the long game I think   the map should look a little bit different so me 
being a greedy player I would tend to favor the   cards in a lot of cases so like we talked about 
you should really try to have a special tile on   the three cards then for even more greed you could 
put mining area on top of the two steel here or   you can put an ocean to get this card over here 
alternatively if the three cards have already been   taken you can put restricted area over here on the 
two titanium because that will allow you to put   mining area up here on the titanium but these are 
just examples it could also be that even though   you're playing the greedy game you still want to 
just like put a tile in the middle of the map here   because then you're kind of blocking the tempo 
players they cannot get what they want in the   middle of the map then it could look something 
like this if you're lucky you can get capital   in the middle of the map here but usually once 
there are four oceans placed I mean this tile is   usually taken before you get to play Capital but 
just a thought then if we continue with this yeah   let's be honest this dream then we can also build 
over here or we can build over to the right if   you have a mangrove or something you can also go 
south usually because there's some desert settler   you want to win so like I said this is probably 
a dream that's not happening to be honest but I   just wanted to show you how I would build the map 
if I just really maximize to get the most points   as possible so since we're being greedy here I 
would tend to favor the card and look at this   color palette man it's beautiful we got cheese we 
got we got dressing we got croutons it's like this   salad looks very tasty to me so basically what 
I'm saying is in Super greedy games you place   your cities in a way so they can score the most 
VP as possible and just for a second compare this   beautiful map to this super boring tempo player 
map oh my God ajaja now let's look at the Tharsis   map which is actually the map from the base game 
is just called Tharsis like the corporation just   to confuse you so first of all let's look at 
the best oceans to place on this map so usually   amongst the top players these are the first three 
oceans to be played on this map the best place to   be is in the middle of the map near the river if 
you can get away with it it's also pretty tasty to   just place an ocean here and then Place something 
next to it like a special tile or something it   could also be a city but like we talked about 
in Tempo games especially you don't really play   that many cities the point is that this tile in 
particular is really important to control and   the reason is that later on once the oceans get 
placed there are some really tasty spots for ocean   rebates right next to this tile and you might be 
thinking hey what what about the two cards and yes   you are correct if you are a greedy player like 
me you will grab the two cards as soon as possible   but even if you are the greedy player there's 
no denying that these oceans here are usually   the best just keep in mind that you kind of want 
to have something on the map if you place these   oceans because otherwise you're just setting up 
your Tempo opponent to take the really good water   rebates and of course if you are the greedy player 
the two titanium can also be nice and we could go   on so here are the most important spots for ocean 
rebates with this very simple calculation a card   is worth 3 steel is worth 2 titanium is worth 
3 plants are worth 2 and you might be thinking   the tile I just mentioned the tile up here is only 
worth 4 but it can really be argued that this tile   is worth a lot more as it got some really juicy 
neighbors this is the best starting tile you could   even make the argument that this tile is worth 
eight or something we could also go a step further   and include these tiles here especially in the 
north there are some high numbers as well but once   again if you take these water rebates you just 
have to keep in mind that these rebates have very   bad portals because like I said the best place to 
be in this map is in the middle of the map and to   illustrate this point about the portals I actually 
have a game in my channel where I got in a little   bit of trouble because I put the Mohole area up 
here on the two cards I don't think it's bad to   go for the cards but considering this was a four 
player game and considering that my strategy was   to close the game as soon as possible this was 
definitely the wrong location so just to give   you some perspective from one of these top tempo 
players Jeffrey Culbert mentioned that this is   definitely the wrong location for Mohole area he 
also said that business contacts where just draw   some cards even this might slow you down because 
Tempo is so important in these Tempo games and he   said well it might actually be okay just because 
now you need to find a new teleport go to the   river I'm not going to read all of this you can 
pause the video if you want but basically I said   to him is it really that bad to take the cards in 
this case I even got insulation which was a huge   pickup and then I asked him if you were playing 
where would you have put the Mohole area and he   said on the one-plant elbow bent ocean so I think 
he was talking about this spot here he did say   one plant so that would technically be the tile 
right underneath this one but I'm guessing this   tile here is better maybe this is what he meant 
just because this tile has two plants instead of   one plant this would probably be better but the 
point is more like now I have a portal to get to   the middle of the map so later on when I play some 
oceans I have some nice water rebates so I'm going   to show you how this game shaped out I had a ton 
of heat production but I didn't have very much   Plant production at least not in the first half 
of the game and by the way this game had two green   players don't ask me how that happened but all 
the tiles that I'm controlling is the tile with   the head of Jacob Fryxelius but as you can see 
it got in a little bit of trouble here because of   these cities that my opponents played so my first 
Greenery conversion was actually really ugly I   just get one steal and then I give an opponent one 
Victory Point luckily my economy was really strong   in this game because of all of the terraforming 
I've been doing so I just ended up building a   city standard project for 25 generally you kind of 
don't want to do this because the standard project   is kind of bad especially if you're going for the 
tempo Strat but in this game I felt I could get   away with it because of my strong economy and 
I really desperately needed a portal to get to   the Mid River I actually placed my city up here 
which is a little bit questionable not gonna lie   the thing is it just had so much plant production 
I just wanted to maximize how many points I could   get out of my greeneries but it is questionable I 
think a better place for the city could have been   here right by the river and then I could convert 
immediately right next to it to deny this tasty   spot from my opponent and then if I wanted to I 
could have even converted one more Greenery in   this generation thanks to the plants I'm getting 
from the good rebate spots and in this case it   didn't really matter that much because soon after 
I also claimed the city to the South near the   river and then I also had noctic City in my hands 
so there's a nice little Empire I'm getting here   it's fine so I think these values here are pretty 
fair I don't think there's anything I would adjust   on this map so once again if we just compare this 
to the map anthracide and StefanF made a while ago   you can see we're pretty much in agreement the 
only difference is that they put a random card   to be 4 and I put a random card to Be 3 and when 
it comes to the best city placements on this map   I would say that this city spot here is the best 
one I know I only put this tile to be 4 but like   I said it could easily be more because look at 
all of these neighbors here it's really good but   if this spot has already been taken which is very 
likely then I think I would be tempted to take the   city over here especially if we are on the first 
generation if no oceans has been placed yet then I   think this spot for a city is pretty good because 
there's so many plants over here and if these   two series spots has been taken I think these two 
also got Plan B they don't actually come with any   placement bonus themselves but they have very good 
neighbors as you can see here and then Noctis City   of course also makes a lot of sense but the thing 
about this city is you don't want to play it too   early I was playing a game where anthracite was 
coaching me and we were doing like a Tempo Strat   like closing the game as soon as possible and he 
actually said that I should keep Noctis city in my   starting hand even and I was like well isn't it 
bad because isn't Tempo really important but he   said no we're just gonna keep it for the entire 
game and then we're gonna play it in the last   generation because the thing is the power of this 
card is not actually the mega credit production   it's very expensive to just get three Mega credit 
production for 18 plus the card plus an energy   production so that surprised me a little bit in a 
tempo game where we just wanted to close the game   as soon as possible anthracite told me to keep 
Noctis city in my opening hand just so I could   play it in the last generation so a map that looks 
something like this could make a lot of sense this   is both for Tempo games and for greedy games but 
once again if you are playing a super fast tempo   game likely you're not gonna have this many cities 
so if we compare this to the map that anthracide   and StefanF made for the best city placement spots 
then we can see that the best city by far is this   one for 36 and it makes a lot of sense and then 
if you cannot get this spot here then the spots   next to it also makes a lot of sense so we got 
32 for this spot here we got 28 for this spot   here but really you kind of want this bot here 
for 36 that's definitely the best spot and then   we got the city spot over here for 23 it's not 
actually as high as this one this one is 24 but   that's of course provided that you'll get maximum 
ocean rebates for all of it so I would still say   this city spot is marginally better in the early 
game because in the early game there are not so   many oceans being placed yet so if I'm going for 
an Omega greedy game I might even do something   like this where I'm going for the cards but even 
then I still want this really good city spot near   the river and once again it doesn't have to be a 
city it can also be experimental forest or some   of these special tiles and speaking of the special 
tiles the two special tiles I put over here to the   left of the map they are a little bit questionable 
like if you look at the value it's only a value   of three by placing here but as I am a little bit 
biased towards getting cards I might even do this   and it also has a little bit side bonus because 
then you can also place mining area next to these   tiles but these are just examples I mean in this 
case if you really did get mining area you would   of course put it up here next to the two ocean 
and then the TEMPO NERDS will probably tell you   that getting cards is kind of bad but if you are 
getting the card to the South you should probably   take the card next to it because this has a better 
portal to the ocean rebates you know but if I am   being greedy I would probably build something like 
this and then at the end of the game it could look   something like this and then of course we should 
throw in ecological zone somewhere because this   card is also really good so let's compare this 
greedy map to how the tempo players would like   to build and it looks something like this so it's 
all about getting the plus two Mega credits for   being next to Ocean it's all about getting all of 
the plants it's all about ending the game as soon   as possible and it's so ugly man it looks like a 
bland salad we got no tomatoes no croutons nothing   but even though it's incredibly ugly there's 
no denying it is a valid way of how you can   play the game so in this game for example I went 
for a Tempo game I ended in generation 9 and the   map looks like this and here is a screenshot from 
a game between random Ronny and Der_Maister who   are both 2K players and as you can see the map 
looks like this so this is definitely a way you   can play the game it does make a lot of sense in 
these Tempo games because then you're just valuing   all the rebates over the points you're getting 
from cities and stuff so it is something you   can do but if you really want to build like this 
you should be ashamed of yourself now let's look   at the hellas map and just to give you a little 
bit of insight we were talking about these maps   and Inquisitor said that Hellas is actually the 
map everyone loves to hate because it's an engine   builders dream so this is a nice place to start 
is this map actually better for engine builders   and for the greedy strategy and yes I do kind 
of agree with Inquisitor it makes a lot of sense   because on this map it's very hard to Ocean Walk 
with greeneries and also the thing is there are   two different bodies of oceans on this map so if 
you are ocean walking next to one of the bodies   of oceans then you can only teleport to get to 
the other one it can be a little bit annoying for   the tempo players and also I think milestones and 
awards slightly favor engine builders on this map   and what I mean is like is only polar explorer and 
cultivator that really caters to the tempo engine   the rest of it really benefits you to have a lot 
of cards and like I mentioned plant production   is also really good for the greedy players so 
even the cultivator it might not be the tempo   player who has the highest chance of getting this 
award so when Inquisitor is saying that hellas is   the engine Builders dream I think this makes a 
lot of sense in most of the games in the early   game there are only two preferred areas on this 
map either you can go to the north where all the   plants are you could go to the South to go for 
the polar Explorer or maybe you just want the   really cheap ocean so once again if you put in all 
the values with Max ocean adjacency bonus then it   looks something like this and it's a little bit 
all over the place in this map and once again   we got a very underappreciated tile with some 
very juicy neighbors especially in the early   game I think this tile here is one of the ones you 
want to go for let's compare this to the map that   anthracite and StefanF made and the first thing 
that I'm wondering is why is this tile worth four   because it doesn't really fit with their pattern 
their pattern is just strictly math they're not   taken into account anything except for math but 
generally speaking we're pretty much in agreement   this tile should definitely have more value 
than just the two because it has some really   good neighbors and they're putting a random card 
to be worth four why I would put a random card   to be worth three but once again they I don't 
think they made this for educational purposes   they literally just had a conversation so I'm not 
going to give them a hard time however it's kind   of interesting that all of us landed on eight when 
we were evaluating how much this tile should be   worth where you can get one extra ocean for six 
Mega credits I don't know how they thought about   it but my thinking is that if a terraform rating 
is worth eight in the early game then a placement   bonus on top of water is worth around six so I 
think this makes a lot of sense and I just gotta   say that I know that these guys were just taking 
the perfect scenarios for all of the tiles but   this tile in particular in the middle of the ocean 
where you get three heats there's no way this is   worth 15 man if you think about it if you set a 
heat to be worth one Mega credit which is what   it looks like they did in the other parts of the 
map then you will have to get literally perfect   rebates for this tile to be worth 15 and that's 
just not happening alright so like I mentioned   you can build in the South because you're going 
for the polar Explorer Milestone or you just   want the cheap ocean and you might be thinking 
where should this ocean go and if you are the   greedy player I think it makes a lot of sense to 
just take the two titanium you can even take the   card if you're desperate but it's not as good but 
here's the thing if you're building in the South   it can be a little bit awkward because you might 
lack a Teleport to go to the north to get the   plants so for example in the first generation if 
you put a tile on top of the free ocean and then   that free ocean is placed in the north to get 
some of the plants up there well now you don't   have a portal to get up there because if you're 
converting into greeneries you have to place them   next to a tile that you own but maybe you have 
another portal in hand maybe you have research   Outpost or something to get up north to get close 
to all of these plants in that case it's of course   fine because on this map it generally looks like 
this where you start the game by playing these   two oceans at the top left and then afterwards you 
put greeneries next to these oceans like this so   in most games players are doing it like this even 
if you don't have a city and the thing is there's   so many plants up here so it just makes a lot of 
sense to build these two oceans and just convert   next to the oceans to get the rebates and then if 
you have a cheap City it makes a lot of sense to   put it here or you can just continue to Ocean 
Walk if you're going for a Tempo game you can   also put a city over here it makes a lot of sense 
you've got a lot of plants you've got a few ocean   rebates and also there's a card close by so it 
doesn't have to be here exactly but generally   speaking I think these are the two best city spots 
it could also be the city here that I personally   am fond of just because it's next to two cards and 
the cheap ocean once again let's look at the map   where anthracite and StefanF calculated the best 
city spots so it's no surprise that this tile up   here is generally the best place you can place a 
city apparently the one underneath it to the left   is also worth 28 but I think this one is a little 
bit worse because it's generally agreed upon that   one steel is worth a little less than one plant 
which means that a city up here is slightly better   and then they put in this spot as one of the best 
spots for a city and I think this is a little bit   questionable this is like assuming that you'll 
get perfect rebates for the ocean and also they   put the cards to be worth four so I think this is 
a little wrong I would much rather have a city up   here for 22 that makes more sense to me and 
then this spot down here where I talked about   this questionable City this is Worth 22 so it's 
not bad but they feel this placement is a little   bit better because it's next to one titanium and 
next to one of the ocean rebates worth two Mega   credits but me personally I would still take the 
one to the left closer to the cards so if you're   ocean walking placing a lot of greeneries next 
to Ocean then you kinda need a Teleport to get to   the other body of oceans and that can be a little 
bit awkward so the oceans and the rebates to the   left are a little bit better to begin with because 
they come with more plants like if you think about   it the first ocean you can place over here to the 
right it will only yield you like one card or one   plant or something and even after you place the 
first Ocean the Second ocean is also gonna be kind   of weak but then it picks up the pace a little 
bit because the third ocean you're gonna place   is gonna be worth four or six or something like 
this and then the last ocean you place on this   island is gonna be worth six at least so if you 
have a strategy where you just plan on placing a   bunch of oceans then it could make sense to build 
on the body of oceans to the right because these   ocean rebates get gradually better and better the 
more oceans you're placing but that being said   I think is still slightly better to play around 
the body of oceans to the left because this area   just has more plants so a typical game for tempo 
players could look something like this where you   have one city here to like connect it all or 
you will have to get like a second portal to   actually get to the other body of oceans so it 
could look something like this and I know what   you're thinking you're thinking I'm about to 
say that this looks like a bland salad with no   tomatoes no croutons no cheese no dressing but 
I'm actually not gonna do that because even the   greedy player like me I can appreciate when I see 
something beautiful and this kind of looks cool   it looks like an Omega flower or something like 
that so I even showed this picture to some other   guys and I even asked them anyone ever managed to 
build greeneries all the way around these seven   ocean tiles like this and mola_ram he answered 
no but it's beautiful even more so if you put a   mangrove in the middle and that just blew my mind 
it's never happening obviously but it's so pretty   to think about so as you probably Gathered By 
now these ocean rebates are really highly valued   especially on the high level so this also means 
that denying your opponents these rebates is also   really important so how can you actually counter 
these Master ocean rebaters first of all you can   just cut them off from rebates you can also steal 
their rebates also don't Place oceans that will   help your opponents and also you can just focus on 
your own game so we're going to talk about all of   this but the first thing we're going to talk about 
is cut them off from rebates because tempo players   will play a bunch of greeneries next to Oceans 
so for example here is your typical Tempo player   if you cut him off from Oceans he will get really 
frustrated and then if you keep doing this he will   get straight up mad I'm telling you guys cutting 
these Tempo players off from rebates is right up   there with telling them that heat production is 
bad they'll get furious so I have a few examples   here so recently I started playing ranked on steam 
just to see how high I can get and one of the few   games I lost before reaching 1800 is against this 
guy Inquisitor who's a really strong player so I   started this game placing an ocean with a prelude 
or something and then a played restricted area   next to it just to get the three cards it's a 
pretty good play I would do it again probably   especially in this game I think it was correct 
because my hand was terrible so I just needed to   find some better cards to play but now we see the 
issue of this play because this tile has no portal   or limited access if you will so Inquisitor 
being the good player that he is he plays his   first Greenery right here so he's kind of cutting 
me off from rebates and he's cutting me off from   the middle of the map like we talked about that is 
the good place to be and then later I built a city   to cut him off from rebates so this is my second 
portal if you will now I have access to the middle   of the map and then he build protected Valley so 
now he also has a second portal and to be honest   in this particular game it wasn't really that big 
of a deal because I wasn't really playing the map   that much I didn't find any plant production 
except for that one plant production I have so   in this game in particular it didn't matter that 
much about all the blocking off of rebates and   stuff like this but it's more like to show you how 
these guys are thinking about the game like really   thinking about ocean rebates and really thinking 
about how to block the other guy so he doesn't   have access to the good places on the map that's 
something the top ELO guys on Steam are really   thinking a lot about when they play and just to 
illustrate my point soon after this Inquisitor   blocked me off completely once again by playing 
land claim and Industrial Center and normally I   would be sad about losing but in this game he 
almost made a flower in the middle of the map   which I thought was quite beautiful here's another 
game played recently against this guy Parker   Parker or if you've watched Dota you probably 
know him better as GoDz he's a Dota 2 commentator   but as of this game I believe he was like the 
third highest rated player on Steam so he's a   very strong player but in this game he started off 
playing experimental Forest on of course the best   tile in the game like we talked about and then 
I played commercial District which is a little   bit questionable but I think it was still fine in 
this case but I played commercial District over   here with the other plants and already here there 
was actually an opportunity to place my commercial   District next to his Greenery just to be very 
annoying and to cut him off from future rebates   but I didn't do that so GoDz he made two oceans 
and then he made this Greenery here and now he's   really ready to start ocean walking but then I 
played this land claim here completely messing   up his plan so that's gonna be very frustrating 
for him and then he got protected Valley which is   basically his second portal so now he can begin 
ocean walking to the south of the river and then   I blocked him again by playing Domed Crater but 
to be honest it's not that big of a deal because   he already has access to the south of the river so 
this block doesn't do that much but then I played   ecological Zone and then immediately I converted 
right next to the ecological zone so this was a   big hit because remember these two tiles are the 
best tiles in the game these two tiles are worth   10 mega Credits per tile so I'm getting these two 
tiles for myself which is really the good but even   more important I'm actually denying GoDz these 
two tiles because he's all in on terraforming so   these two tiles are definitely something he wanted 
and also remember anthracite's point from earlier   that if you're playing a two-player game then 
these tiles are sort of kind of double in value   because I'm getting these tiles but also GoDz is 
not getting these tiles and to be honest I still   lost this game because GoDz he closed the game in 
generation 9 and I made a few huge mistakes that   I'm gonna talk about on episode 6 but that being 
said my tile laying was still kind of good it's   still a good thing to actually block him off from 
rebates so GoDz kinda got the last laugh in this   one so he turned back into this nice little 
innocent happy flower here and to be honest   this is probably a more fair representation of 
what GoDz is actually like he's actually a super   chill dude he's one of the nicest guys I've ever 
met so just like cutting people off from rebates   is really important you should also steal their 
rebates if possible so stealing their rebates is   a big swing at both Mega credits and plants and 
even if you give them VP for planting next to   their city it's still worth it most of the time 
and like anthracite was talking about it's extra   important to steal rebates in two-player games 
so the most extreme example I have of this is   an entirely different game where I played a much 
lower rated opponent so his first city was really   good it's on the good spot and then my first 
conversions is next to Noctis city so he sort of   blocked me down here I suppose but it's really not 
a big deal because I wasn't planning on going this   way with my greeneries instead I built the city 
up here and then also stole his first rebate and   then I placed this land claim here which is really 
good because I know that later in the game this   tile itself will give him 10 mega credit worth of 
value so I just continued to steal his rebates and   you probably know where this is going I actually 
end up stealing all of his rebates from the city   so I actually planted five greeneries around his 
City or in other words I almost reversed flowered   him and to be clear reversed flowered is actually 
not an expression I just made that up so I planted   five greeneries around his City and you might be 
thinking what are you crazy I just gave him five   victory points but the thing is I also stole from 
him one steel five plants and 20 Mega credits so   in total what I stole from him is 32 Mega credits 
worth of value so is that better than five victory   points I would argue yes and once again remember 
this idea that these values are kind of double   because we are playing a two player game and to be 
honest some of the greeneries I played around his   City also helped my city but even if it didn't I 
think this would still be worth it and another way   to counter these Master ocean rebaters is simply 
to not Place oceans that will help your opponents   so if you do not intend to play the map then it 
might actually be better to not create the best   oceans in the middle of the map because then 
you're just helping your opponent right what   I mean is if you place these four oceans and then 
you do nothing then well you're just setting your   opponent up to place all of these juicy spots 
we discussed before so if you're placing these   four oceans it must be because you yourself are 
intending to play something next to these oceans   here's a much easier representation of how not 
to help your opponent so let's say your opponent   already placed this city maybe had research 
Outpost or something in that case you should not   place this water because then you're just helping 
him because now you've just given your opponent an   easy way to claim these ocean rebates next to his 
City so that's not good and finally you could just   focus on your own game I mean if you are a greedy 
player if you just want to go for the long game   just play your game it's fine but actually this is 
a little bit of a terrible piece of advice because   at the very least you should block him with like a 
land claim or special tile or something you should   do something to interrupt his Little Empire of 
ocean walking so technically this one should be   just focus on your own game but at the same time 
block him as much as possible finally I want to   talk about the aquifer is this a good standard 
project because Der_Maister said something very   interesting he said also something that dawned on 
me very late is the value of rebates I think you   don't value them as highly as you're not really 
on board with the SP ocean which is one of the   most crucial SP for the early game in my opinion 
I also didn't realize their value when trying to   math every production out correctly oceans plants 
and tiles have a huge amount of value if you   combine them and this actually is what makes the 
tempo play so strong you get those oxygen points   but you also get a lot of cash back when you play 
your Greens especially on Elysium and Tharsis so   basically Der_Maister here is describing exactly 
why the tempo strategy is so strong and I agree   that the Tempo strat is really good but I still 
am not on board with the SP ocean so I replied to   him that regarding ocean rebates I can appreciate 
how four or six Mega Credits and two plants can be   powerful especially considering you could play 
Oceans as your first action and then Greenery   special tiles or something next to it but even 
still you don't always get the dream placement   like this so what is an average placement bonus 
of an ocean worth if the plants you get is exactly   the plants you need in order to convert into a 
Greenery then its great otherwise I just can't   agree that it's a crucial standard project in 
the early game it's still rather expensive we   just established that the TR is worth around 8 
Mega credits in the early game and then declining   this means that the value of a placement bonus on 
the ocean itself should be like 10 mega credits   I know that you guys love your rebates but geez 
ocean cards I can understand but personally I'm   not that crazy about the ocean standard project 
so originally it said that I placement bonus is   around four and that means that you're overpaying 
by six I'm willing to meet Der_Maister halfway and   say that a placement bonus is worth around six 
and therefore you're only overpaying by four but   why does Der_Maister who is a strong player still 
think that ocean standard project is good in the   early game I think it's because like he alluded to 
there are some hidden bonuses of placing an ocean   first of all it's important to understand that 
you have two actions so you can set yourself up   to get a better rebate as your second action also 
if you're placing an ocean on Plants it may allow   you to convert into a Greenery immediately and 
finally and this one is just me being a little   bit biased against these TEMPO NERDS but to be 
honest this is part of it if you are playing   the tempo game then you want to close the game so 
placing this aquifer standard project just helps   you close the game and that's pretty much all for 
this video so special thanks to all of the top   ELO players on Steam I actually do appreciate all 
the input they've given me even though I've made   fun of them a little bit calling them TEMPO NERDS 
and stuff like this if you do feel like I've been   a tad too offensive regarding the whole TEMPO 
NERD thing then I would ask that you direct all   all of your anger towards Der_Maister who 
practically forced me to do it as evidenced   by the conversation here at the bottom of the 
screen so yeah do that thanks for watching!! :D so how can you actually counter 
these Ocean Master rebaters laughs
