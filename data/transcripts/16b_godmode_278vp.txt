[Music] Hello and welcome. My name 
is Boneless. Today we are   looking at a game that I played with Point 
Luna and the Preludes here are all right   I'm not getting one of the really 
good preludes but these two are okay   one of the preludes actually had an earth 
tag so I kind of had to take that one   so this is like a replay of a game I played a 
while back and I'm gonna try to talk quick because   I already cut this down to one hour so game is 
game is going very quick I'm already stressed so I   the two preludes there pretty all right it gives 
me some extra cards I wasn't that happy with   my starting hand so I kind of gambled and took 
some extra cards and definitely paid off right   here I'm getting Sponsors also on Earth Tag very 
nice Business Network also an Earth Tag and then   I'm getting uh one of the really good cards Mars 
University I really like that oh my God I topdeck   Earth catapult as well is very good but the mars 
University is one of the cards I really favor in   these long uh two-player games because it just 
uh you can rotate so many cards and especially   with Point Luna it kind of adds up right because 
Point Luna draws a lot of card which means I'm   gonna get a lot of science tags which mean I 
could get a lot of value from Mars University and interestingly I also kept Herbivores in 
my starting hand I know this is a card that   can give me a lot of points later on in the game 
but it is yeah it is a little bit greedy to uh   to keep it this early on but I felt like okay 
with away with Io Mining Industries obviously   perfect at this point Titanium mine also great I 
mean this is a high scoring game so obviously I'm   gonna have a lot of uh I'm gonna be very lucky I 
already am happy I get Earth catapult and I get   a lot of stuff so this guy uh or girl I guess 
uh I I'm very awkward when it comes to making   people on the internet like me so I I don't know 
what to to respond to to a person like this but   yeah so I remember there is a choice here   I could have gone for Io mining Industries before 
playing Earth catapult but I think I calculated   and the Earth catapult plus the one titanium 
production would be just a slightly better but   there is a case to be made to actually play Iron 
mining Industries before you play Earth catapult   because I have catapult is also very expensive 
so already we're in generation three um I hope   you guys can can still keep up I feel like I had 
to cut this down because in the end this replay   is still gonna be like one hour long which is 
probably uh long enough in and of itself so but to give you some context this is a game where 
both players both me and the other guy had an hour   to play which is uh it was desperately needed I 
think because um I'm ending up spending most of my   time and the thing is when you go for this greedy 
card strategy an hour is not a long time so uh   but here this card basically is two Mega 
Credit-production and the placement bonus but   I can get a card with it actually I get two cards 
because it has an earth tag and then I I place it   uh on the acraeus mons I guess which 
also gives me a card so uh very nice   and then here I'm just uh playing 
hackers pretty it's only generation   three so I think it's definitely worth 
getting the two Mega Credit production even though I I end up losing a point on 
it then I topdeck Miranda Resort obviously   also perfect I already like played a lot of 
Earth Tags maybe I think four or something   we can actually see now I go from three to nine 
okay I played six Earth takes yeah that's perfect and now I think this generation uh I'm 
probably looking to to play Iron Mining   Industries this card's in my hand for so long 
and it's juicy I wanna I wanna to play it   so Electro catapult also a great card 
for engine building and we're still   in the early game so engine building is 
definitely what I'm thinking about here   engine building and cards and then I know that I 
have a great engine so I'm also looking at oh here   I do the math right so 26 plus 12 it's 38 really 
want to play Io mining industries so I'm not going   to buy this card it's a it's a lot of yeah look 
at this I'm spending all my resources so this is   the reason I'm not buying this card otherwise 
this card Rover construction is actually fine but uh it's so fast when I'm when I'm playing this game 
I remember being stressed but when I'm uncasting   it afterwards after I actually cropped 
down to one hour holy poop this is fast   there's gonna be a lot of actions in a row 
especially later on so I hope I hope you can   keep up I have a hard time doing it So Cartel is 
obviously godlike you can buy up to four cards are   we not playing crafting I guess we're not playing 
drafting I think I joined the game this time   normally I played drafting but this time I think 
it joined the game so uh no what what happened oh okay I did buy them I just okay I'm already 
confusing myself but apparently I did buy three   cards here I just uh it I just cut the video so 
it looked like I only bought one which uh I was   just about to Flame myself but this is actually 
fine so this card here I think I'm at the point   where I just want cards in my hand uh because I 
know that I have a perfect game here or at least   a really good start so I know that that at this 
point I think I'll just keep most of the cards I   see just because I plan on playing Mars University 
and then I actually need bad cards to cycle here   so the card I just bought is probably the one I'm 
gonna cycle here I'm guessing yeah let this piece   of trash like it's uh it can be okay later but we 
are nowhere near six percent and it's not really   an impactful card so it's a perfect card to just 
throw away to get a new card with Mars University um so you know you're having a really good 
game when you're actually just buying cards   just so you have bad bad cards to 
cycle then you know you're golden   so Indentured workers I think it's still 
early enough that I would prefer this one   if I had a lot of energy production I would 
take the one to the right but yeah at this   point I definitely know that the five gold I get 
from indentured workers is definitely worth it um I actually uh um if you're wondering what my 
opponent is doing uh it's it's gonna be on the   screen for just the briefest moment sometimes I 
try to include this but obviously mostly we're   here to see this this big score and this yeah 
cartel right cartel seems good how much gold   seven and seven okay it's pretty good I couldn't 
maybe there's an argument to be made that I should   have played the technology demonstration before I 
play cartel yeah now I'm playing it it's not good   it's actually I should have played that 
before because I could have topdecked another   Earth Tag here right so a bit a bit of a misplay 
right there but when it comes to high scores   inTerraforming Mars I don't really care about high 
scores and the funny thing is I actually wrote in   the in the Terraforming Mars Facebook group I just 
wrote well does anybody even keep track of scores   it's a is it even a thing does anybody have a 
spreadsheet and I think the general consensus   nobody gives a poop nobody really cares about 
highscores and I to be honest I don't really care   either right here I just keep bad cards once again 
because I want the cycle it with Mars University   um so I I just thought that I would still 
include this one because the score is so high   um it's probably the highest score you'll see um 
at least on YouTube the thing is this Mars app   only comes with Prelude and vanilla so it's 
it's really hard to get big scores normally   if you play with colonies and stuff it's a 
bit easier to achieve the really high scores um but the so I thought I should include this 
because this episode is where we look at like   the greedy card strategy and this is like this 
is a dream scenario for the greedy card strategy   so you notice I already I have a huge amount of 
cards I have 16 cards and I have just a great   engine and if you like I talked about when you 
have both card-draw and engine this is where   you can can really go insane and every time 
you hit 200 plus in terraforming Mars it is   with this greedy card strategy at least that's 
the vast majority you could technically do it   like with a City Strat if you're golden 
but like it's it's hard to differentiate   right because even in that case you can make an 
argument that you still have to have a lot of   good cards you still did the card strategy 
to some extent when you're hitting these   big scores yeah the point I'm trying to make 
the big scores are usually the card strategy so medical lab is probably a card I'm 
thinking about right now looks tasty   I haven't played my catapult yet I guess uh 
I'm really lacking this uh energy production   and the other available plays I had were really 
good so but this is also fine I can start right   now we're hitting the mid game so I'm fine 
beginning to to get some plant production going   I think plant-production is really strong but I 
think you should do it right here in the mid game especially because I have one of the amplifiers 
in my hand I have the nitrogen Rich asteroid I   believe it's called yeah this one so when I 
have this card obviously it's also very good   to to start playing plant tags I'm 
wondering if I have three right now   yeah so I'm buying probably the last one as 
well search for Life yeah I'm buying all four   usually when I have this good of a game I just buy 
all four so I have something to cycle with it's but this is like the the definition of 
the card strategy you you you're being   really gready you're creating a huge engine 
you're like keeping most of the cards you see   and somehow you end up playing all of it and 
it's gonna be resulting in like a lot of points so I'm definitely also thinking about the 
milestones at this point I see that already   uh the card Milestone has been claimed I Believe 
by me it would make sense I have so many cards   so I don't want to take them too early 
like also talked about but right now at   this point this is about the time where 
I really want to look at the milestones yeah discarding flooding makes sense at this point my hand is so good 
that like like a card like Plantation I just   I have Herbivores in my hand so I know that 
this is gonna end up giving me a lot of points   so mineral deposit and what am I doing 
with this I could be just buying a   hmm I'm actually playing this card I guess 
I must have played decomposers or something hmm yeah okay I see I played the other card 
the card that makes plant tags cheaper okay   that makes sense because in this case I can 
just keep collecting microbes on this card   and it will make my plant tags cheaper 
to play so that makes a lot of sense   okay finally I'm getting some energy production 
and I'm sure that I'm looking at the Catapult   because I really want to get this down why 
on Earth okay because I have plants of course   yeah so I can use the plants to power my 
catapult yeah that makes sense I was just   thinking why am I spending all my steel but 
I have a ton of plants so it's not a problem so I'm okay with terraforming 
the heat I'm I'm predicting   that it's probably not gonna be the heat 
that's like the last parameter to close   so I'm probably aiming to to take a 14 
generation game here because I know that   I have so much stuff going for me and an ultra 
late game I'm just gonna make a ton of points okay Plantation I guess I needed the last plant 
tag otherwise it's not that good oh this is   interesting I actually like I don't have a city 
on the map yet so this Plantation looks really   ugly but I think at this point we're still early 
enough in the game that I have to play it right   because I need to play this nitrogen-rich 
asteroid now I have seven plant production   definitely worth it but the thing is I don't 
really just wanna play a city for 25 just so I   could get that plus one point I mean it's at this 
point the the VP is not the important part of it   so I think it makes sense to just make this 
ugly Greenery in the middle of nowhere because   I needed the plant tag and it gives me 
a little bit of resources right there now I'm stealing his plant his energy production   and medical lab is probably on the cards 
and yeah I played my catapult so um yeah we're vibing I don't even know okay 
I go for Zeppelins that makes sense yeah   I have plenty of Mega credit 
production and nobody's really   building cities in this game so getting rid 
of Zeppelins definitely makes sense yeah this search for Life card I don't know 
man it's ah even it's so cheap and it   has a science tag so this is why this card 
is good but if it didn't have a science tag   and even after you have played as I sometimes 
feel bad about even going for the search for   life because you pay one one Mega credit all the 
time and and usually you're never getting it like   it's not a lot of micro cards in this in this 
game especially vanilla so it's ah all right so   I did get the planner so I'm now looking at the 
rest and the even though I could claim one here   I'm actually gonna wait I'm gonna wait until 
my opponent is close to claiming a milestone   um because it's a little bit more efficient 
this way so now I have a fine opportunity to   play a city here I I did get all my engine down 
so at this point I think it's an okay time to   start building cities I need to have one sooner or 
later right because I have seven plant production so preferably see I I could even have drawn a card   first to see if that was a city card 
maybe that would have been better but to be honest this placement bonus of the 
city was pretty good it was next to water   and then I can get this Greenery down with one 
steel and four gold for water so it's a pretty   nice place for a city so maybe I just wanted to 
to get the placement bonus as soon as possible immigration shuttles um seems like an 
idea it's it's not a great card at this   point but it seems like the best 
engine building card I really have um so I could still be considering this the reason 
is not the best card is like the five Mega credit   production it's not like so great in generation 
8 and nobody's really building cities but   I think I figured I had a ton of titanium here so 
I probably still want to want to buy it just for   this reason and also I'm thinking I have the 
dream games the sooner or later I'm probably   gonna build a bunch of cities yeah natural 
Preserve I just want this uh while I can   because it has a maximum 4 oxygen requirement heat 
Trappers heat trappers okay this one well okay I'm wondering why I wanted heat Trappers 
over this card there's an argument to be   made that when you want a long game you can 
play heat Travis just to to decrease enemy heat production a little bit and this way 
the game is going to be a little longer but   in this case the heat is probably going 
to be the first parameter to close so I   don't know why I'm keeping heat trappers 
but I'm guessing that sooner or later I'm   probably gonna cycle heat trappers as well 
so it probably doesn't make a difference oh Advanced Alloys holy hell I got 
Advanced Alloys yeah there we go let's go   Advanced Alloys and I still haven't spent 
my six titanium at this point very nice Tardigrades um I think I I don't like this 
card but I have decomposers in my hand and   this card can probably end up giving 
him one point so it's okay in this case oh man I hate Tardigrades so much so uh yeah herbivores uh I need eight oxygens 
to get herbivores a bit awkward I think it was   mistaken earlier I said that the plant tags 
would help me because I have herbivores I   think that's a mistake herbivores is actually 
the card where you get the VP when you put   down greeners you can half an animal or half a 
point per animal when you put down greeneries so   I'm wondering if I'm also going to 
get ecological Zone in this game hmm yeah I'm just keeping everything like it's 
it's not the cards are not the that great but   um I need cards to cycle um so uh it's uh 
pretty amazing that this guy hasn't claimed   any Milestones yet now he's even starting 
this generation but it seems like he's not   the he's not playing for any of them okay 
um I'm now seeing that he has two greeneries   and I'm like I'm also checking I'm checking 
is it close to anything else and he's not so   but he did have two Greenery put down so 
he could make one more Greenery and take   a get a point so that's why I'm I'm 
now claiming the gardener milestone AI Central it's a little bit late but 
it's still great Aerobraked Ammonia   asteroid get rid of it no to be fair lava 
flows is not good at this point as well   I mean I could actually spend use lava flows 
to get the water bonus so I don't know I mean   I think my reason is probably I have so much 
titanium and advanced alloys so maybe maybe   this is one of the few games where I actually 
play Aerobraked Ammonia asteroid but hard to say yeah and you're gonna see like even 
though the first Generations were so fast   because I'm playing this super greedy with all the 
cards I could get huge engine super greedy card   strategy like the last few Generations is gonna 
be insane as I'm gonna have so many actions so   so we're far from over this whole replay after 
I cropped it down is still one hour or so   yeah okay now I'm finally 
playing it it makes sense   I mean if I'm gonna play sooner later I 
might as well do it now because it gives   me five Mega credit production it's not 
it's not nothing it's just not as great Callisto Penal Mines   kind of the same thing it's like 
I kind of want to play it because   it has at least three Mega credit 
production but it doesn't really it's not the greatest but I also play I also want 
to play this card at some point because I'm going   for jovians basically when you're having the 
God game like this you're kind of going through   everything I'm going for jovians I'm going for 
City Synergy I'm going for plant production   I just want all of it because I can the only 
strategy I'm not really using here would be   the terraforming strategy where I will try 
to close the game I'm actually going to do   the opposite I'm gonna try to to to to um well 
not really drag it out but I'm not really uh   trying to terraform too much especially the 
oxygen I'm still gonna use my plants because I   don't think I have protected habitat but uh in any 
case if the game goes to 14 I'm happy if it goes   to 13 I'm happy at this point I have no doubt 
in my mind that I'm gonna win the game so all   right satellites still a bit late but very good 
card how many uh space tags do I have I Wonder I have seven yeah satellite is definitely the way 
to go then so for for six plus three for the card   so for nine Mega credits I can get seven at least 
seven because I can even draw more cards right   and now I'm claiming the last Milestone because 
he's close oh actually he left at this point okay yeah I'm just gonna that's pretty much it 
the awards uh I feel like there's probably   no Awards here that that I need to start right 
now I'm probably golden in like most of them   get the card there we go so I 
did get the bonus even though I   sold the The Volcano card what's it 
called lava flows so it's all right Oh and now I got the other one   I really like this combo Olympus conference it's 
very late it will be like insane if I had this   card earlier in the game but the the combo with 
Olympus conference and Mars University this is   actually really strong I think it's just it's so 
much value from science tags and especially if you   if you're like a nerd like me and you played a lot 
of terraforming mars it's a very valuable to be   able to cycle cards and be able to to draw cards 
because you can get a lot of value from them so um Mars University is just when it comes to draw 
cards that's definitely one of the best ones I   think sure you can have games where you literally 
get no science tags and then it's it's not good of   course but in most games especially in two-player 
games Olympus conference I mean it's just insane like just this card Trans-Neptune Probs 
now it's only two Mega credit and I can   and I can get so much value just 
because it has a science tag right so this card I just played basically is a   two Mega credit production so it doesn't 
really do much but it was so cheap that I   might as well and also it has an earth tag Earth 
tag also works with events with my cooperation   Point Luna so I am gonna draw a card with 
when I play event earth tags so it's good I'm wondering if this game is like progressing 
too fast I'm wondering if if I should have   like just taking my time and make a replay 
analysis that's like three hours long but   I don't know nobody has time for that 
right so it's probably also the only   replay worth noting that's gonna be this long 
because all the other replays I'm not gonna   I'm not gonna show too many of these God 
game games like one one is probably enough   so if if you're curious uh I've had uh scores 
close to this one this is the high score on   the app in real life my high score is higher but 
once again who cares there are so many different   things when it comes to high scores it's like it's 
both if you're in the two-player game you're gonna   score higher if you have more expansions available 
you're gonna score higher if your opponent is bad   you're gonna score higher if the game is dragging 
out so so you have to make like a high score list   that's like 10th Generation 11 12 13 14 and on top 
of that you have to take into account number of   players and everything there's so many different 
factors so this is the reason why nobody cares oh   ecological Zone there we go yay now I can get 
even more points for my plant tags very nice   right here what's on my mind is definitely the the 
bonus the temperature bonus on the oxygen scale   I kind of want that and then maybe starting 
with first award is on my mind um this might be   I think my biggest mistake in this game 
I make a few I may have missed but I make   a few mistakes one of the mistake is 
not starting all three Awards sooner   I think I was I was a little bit pressed for 
time a little bit stressing because I had so   many actions I had to make but the and also I 
just I just assumed that I would win all of them   automatically I just assumed that I would crush 
it my opponent in every single uh award so there   was no need to actually start anything but if 
I'm not mistaking I believe this is a game where   he at some point started miner which really 
annoyed me because he ended up winning that   and it's not the end of the world 
honestly it's it's not like I just um but but the reason why it it was actually 
important in this case is because I believe   I'm gonna pass um the last generation while I 
actually have like maybe 30 gold or something   30 Mega credits I couldn't spend on anything 
because the map was filled and I don't have   access to Venus scale and stuff like this 
so so sometimes it happens you just you   literally have an excess of money in 
the last generation you can't spend   so when this is the case I should have 
recognized that this guy was was could   compete with me in the miner and I should have I 
should have just started all three of them but the it is what it is and to be fair if I win three milestones 
and two Awards out of three is probably   still fine right oh colonizer training 
camp do I have do I have a card so I can   play this because I need like uh one of the 
cards that can enable me to play this card   I wonder if I've played that it has a science 
tag so it would make sense that I played this   you know the science card that that make it oh 
there we go adaption technology yeah yeah yeah so this is one of the few cases where adaptive 
technology actually comes up clutch like I think   I already would play this card because I have so 
many so much science Synergy but normally this is   not a good card but in this particular case it 
allows me to play colonizer training camp so of   course it's pretty nice so it's a bit greedy I'm 
not taking the bonus even though I could because I   wanted to to play my colonizer training camp first 
but now I should definately take the bonus right   that's what I have to do here oh okay I see yeah so okay I remember so uh I I 
kind of want to take the bonus even now here that   I'm casting I'm like Boneless take the bonus take 
the bonus but actually I I just I just uh it's   hard to say if I'm messed up actually because I 
just cheated myself from a point herbivores would   have given me plus one point if I played that 
before these two obviously because I have adaptive   technology this is why I could have played it now 
I think this is what I missed that I could have   played uh herbivores before this because in my 
mind herbivores is just eight oxygen requirement   but I just didn't realize that I just played 
adaptive technology so I could play before but it   actually ends up being okay I think because what 
happens is that the I think I have and probably   if I don't have it already I'm gonna pick up the 
protected habitats and then I'm gonna actually   I believe it's the case that I'm gonna wait a 
long time before playing this card Herbivores   which means that I now have a lot more Mega credit 
to spend on on a bit more engine and one of the   other nice things so even though I missed one 
VP here I think it's like it kind of evens out   in the end because I'm I'm just gonna be very 
greedy from now on and I'm gonna hold on to my   plants because I have protected habitat because I 
want the game to drag out to go to 14 Generations   I have a I just have an unspoken rule with myself 
that I I will never allow a game to go to 15   Generations it's like a it's a it's a bit too much 
it's uh it's it's uh you should yeah it's hard to   explain it's just like if you do this then you're 
deliberately just not closing the game right   so on 14 Generations you should be able to to 
do everything you want to do in a game and also   worth noting at this point I've I've noticed that 
my opponent is not in the game anymore I think   if if my opponent were in the game I might 
not have dragged the game out intentionally   maybe I don't know it's hard to say it makes some 
might consider it to be in a little bit of a bad   Spirit to drag it out just to get a big score even 
though it's completely obvious that I'm winning at   this point but since I'm playing against an 
AI because the guy left then fine whatever immigrant City isn't it time for this 
because I want to yeah it is okay   yeah that's a good place for City so obviously my production is quite insane 
it's not the it's not the biggest ever but   45 Mega credit six titanium and 
11 plant obviously it's very good   um so the thing is that all of my cards 
I'm gonna I only have 13 cards now   and it's it's gonna be pretty quick for me to 
play my entire hand at this point so I think   this is why I'm I'm really looking at the map now 
I think my plan is to just fill out the entire map   and if you're getting close to 300 in in like 
this uh not close to 300 but if you're getting   like this like like 270 something score 
I've gotten a few times then obviously you   just need to milk the entire game for all the 
points to get a score like this basically you   need the entire map you need a bunch of synergy 
in your hands you need all the point amplifiers   so in this case I don't think I got all the Jovian 
amplifiers but I don't even think it's like about   that what I am getting for example is right 
here while enhancer is going to give me a lot   oh am I stealing for myself 
no he has lifestyle okay easy   I think it went for the fish because it makes more 
sense to me that the bear eats fish I can picture   this in my head sometimes it's very awkward 
for me when I play in real life and there's   a Venus expansion and then there's like this card 
venusian animals and then the bear actually has to   to be on Mars be a bear and then he's like putting 
on his spacesuit then he's going to trip to Venus   then he's taking off his spacesuit and then he's 
actually gonna eat a venusian animal oh that was   tasty and then he's gonna go back in his spaceship 
and go back to Mars again and this is very awkward   to me at I don't really I don't understand 
how this is logic but that's how Mars works   but in this case it's very very cool the the 
bear eats a fish I think this is very plausible um so yeah I only have 8 card left so 
I'm wondering should I just close the   game should I spend my plants just well 
like nah screw it let's have some fun definitely I kind of want to play at 
this point because why am I even what   I think I think I really 
should play this card right   because I want to play oh here yeah miner you 
didn't see it you actually behind in miner oh man   yeah but the rest of them I'm winning I 
just assumed that I was gonna win all of   them so I didn't start anything it's very 
greedy of me but the definitely a mistake   and then I made a few other mistakes in this game 
I just can't I guess the herbivore mistake was   You could argue is a mistake I mean you could 
also argue it wasn't a mistake because if   my opponent had been good maybe he would have 
taken the the bonus instead of me and then it's   hard to say but the biggest one the one I feel 
most salty about is not winning all the awards So Cupola City seems good definitely want cities at this point yea the two tiles I'm looking at here I think 
makes the most sense um it's like you want when   you're creating your Empire you want this kind of 
pattern if that makes sense this pattern where the   greeneries can hit two of your cities and two 
of the uh the next city you're making so so you   can put two greeneries behind your two cities if 
that makes sense this kind of pattern you see here   this is like the the maximum way to get points if 
you have the entire map for yourself that is but Asteroid   nah okay so I think I'm done actually picking up 
bad cards because I think I have enough bad cards   in my hand to cycle with so I'm I am no longer 
picking up dead cards just so I can cycle this   is this is done oh there we go I have ants so 
I'm putting microbes on ants but this is the game   where I didn't do that for a long time where I 
just put it on decompose I think it is decomposer   23 yeah oh yeah I missed like two points here or 
something uh and not right now but early in the   game I think I missed a couple of points because 
I put extra microbes on decomposers instead of   ants in my head they just both gave the same 
maybe I didn't remember I had ants or something   but the Ants is ants gives Point per two microbes 
and decomposers gives points per three microbes   so definitely I should have just like pumped 
up my Ants instead so uh small mistake there at least early in the game now I think I 
noticed so from this point on I'm gonna I'm   gonna put it on the Ants so but yeah look at 
all this stuff I have man this is what I mean   it's not even about the Jovian amplifiers 
it's about all of this green tag synergy   like insane of course Jovian amplifiers 
are also very nice in a game like this   um I think maybe I'm getting three out of four 
or maybe only two out of four I can't remember but yeah look at this 36 plants in my hand yeah 
I definitely I I don't remember seeing myself uh   actually play it but but I'm not keeping 36 plants 
in my hand if I don't have a protected habitat so   okay this land claim is kind of cool sometimes you 
can use land claim to actually annoy the other guy   and stuff like this put it in the middle of the 
Empire but this is actually if I do say so myself   a pretty clever Land claim because this makes it 
a hundred percent sure that I'm gonna put a city   there right because normally if you put a clan 
claim I'm like oh I want to put a city there then   the other guy is just going to put a city right 
next to the land claim but in this case that's   impossible because there are no valid spots right 
next to the Land claim to put a city so this means   that I have a pretty good shot of getting the city 
um so a very clever land claim good job Boneless   select a card to discard Black Polar Dust I hate 
this card it's never good but it does give water   yeah strip mine whatever I think strip mine makes 
sense because I have 36 plants in my hand so   why would I I'm probably gonna get the points I also have Greenhouses I have so many 
plants it's a and once again I I think   I only do this because my my opponent is 
like left the game and there's a hard AI   I don't feel bad about about a griefing a 
hard AI by not closing the game it's okay yeah Black Polar Dust get rid of it I remember it came like as a 
surprise to me that I actually   had so much gold left at the end I believe that 
goes to 14 Generations so when that is the case um I'm feeling very bad about not starting 
all the awards I might as well have done that   but I still have the thing is I 
have seven production in the in   the miner right and you're I don't know 
I just haven't checked my opponent but   apparently he ends up getting getting 
even more than me in the miner so very annoying imported nitrogen this card is so 
insane when I have a god game like this one I   can get a lot of discard discount so this card 
is very good in the late game when I have a lot   of discount and then I have ants and I have uh 
some animals that gives one point I know that   of predator for example and also it has an earth 
tag so it also draws make out on the late game   so a large Convoy imported nitrogen great 
cards to have I'm just gonna I'm gonna I   don't even care if I get the water on the 
large Convoy it would be nice if I did but   it's not even the the point of this card 
the point is to just get a bunch of points   in the late game I could actually play 
it now it's not bad I have seven titanium   um but maybe I'm I'm afraid to actually terraform 
because I want the game to go to 14 not sure   so this is what I mean I could have played 
herbivores before and it would probably have   been better but then if he had taken the bonus 
I would have been sad anyway but at the same   time not playing it like three generations ago 
it's like 10 mega credit I instead use on other   things so it's it's the one point I'm missing 
it's almost worth it if you know what I mean hmm I'm thinking about getting 
the plant what did I just play oh this one that makes sense yeah of 
course in this case I take the plant   I think I'm just making a a microbe on this 
card just so my Ants has something to eat   which is kind of funny robotic Workforce uh I I I 
have I had this for a long time because I wanted   to play this with medical lab right okay I'm 
doing it now but shouldn't I've done this some   time ago oh maybe I just picked it up but yeah 
this is insane this is one of the it's actually   the combo in in vanilla mars because I don't 
have access to cards like Gyropolis and stuff   like this so medical lab robotic Workforce such 
a strong combo in vanilla it's really really good   Toll station makes sense I mean it makes 
sense if I get more than six Mega credit   from my opponent so it actually depends how 
many tags he has or if the game goes to 14   then it would have been it would be 12 Mega 
credit I get from my opponent if he has six yeah this also makes a lot of sense so I'm looking a lot at a lot of 
these cards I'm like oh man I wish   I had those sooner but you know you can't 
have everything oh no no this is this a bug   I should be able to play it with only 
one right I have Advanced Alloys game insects another card I wish I had sooner would 
have been very good for me but at the same time   I think there is a point just like heat at 
some point you can't use it anymore there's   also a point where plants at some point you can't 
actually use it anymore if the map gets filled up   it doesn't happen very often but in a God game 
like this it's entirely reasonable that it would   happen especially if I let it go to to 14 I 
mean look at this I have 60 plants 20 plant   production and 60 plants and I haven't even 
played insect yet yeah this this map is gonna   this is gonna get filled up actually my 
priority right now to be honest should   be to get all the good City spots I don't 
think maybe I'm I'm relaxed a little bit   about it because I'm just playing against 
an AI but but okay I am doing it yeah this   is exactly what I need to do right now I need 
to get as many of the city placements as I can that's definitely what I have to do at 
this point I'm expecting to fill up the   map with cities in this generation 
at least this is what I should do yeah I am okay one to the left 
I think yeah probably better maybe I'm thinking if my 
opponent does this and stuff but yeah this makes sense so now I have all the good 
okay the deck has been reshuffled Jesus now I   have all the good uh placement bonuses but 
there's still like two more cities I can get   okay there we go herbivores it's it's a time 
that I start spending all my plants it seems oh did he pass no he didn't okay I think I'm waiting 
for him to pass the generation because   when he passes the generation I 
know that I can I'm I'm I know I   know that I wanted to close it at 14 
so when he passes I'm gonna terraform   like until there's like one spot left or something 
if that makes sense so just it just barely goes   to 14 Generations because then I have getting 
the maximum out of the terraform rating as well uh Power infrastructure could actually 
give me a little bit in the last generation   yeah yeah Aquifer pumping Aquifer 
pumping aquifer pumping yes good job   Boneless Dust seals peppe hands yeah that's probably not 
a lot of good cards left but the it's also the   cards that I discard with my trash search for 
Life cards right so there could be some good   cards still left in the reshuffled deck I also 
don't know what my opponent has discarded so but the yeah it makes sense start to terraform the 
water a little bit because I I expect that   my opponent is not gonna close the game I could actually 
play large Convoy right now   just to get the last water placement bonus but I must have a read that my opponent 
is not gonna just make four greeneries   because if he did that I would be really 
sad so I must have a pretty good read that   my opponent is not going to close the game 
because if he could close the game at this   point it would be a bad idea to to make all 
the all the aquifier all the water placements okay ants ants and yes good [Music]   but like this is what I mean this game 
normally 45 minutes or even half an hour   that's that's enough to play a game of 
terraforming Mars on the app but it's uh   when you're having a God game this is why I I 
usually queue for one hour games because when   you're having a God game like this like 45 
minutes is nothing because there's just so   many actions it's not only my actions I have to 
wait for the game to do all the animations so I think I am stressing a little bit about the 
time it could be oh one more fish for the bear   nice Bear is happy hmm but I mean search for life I'm not 
gonna get it am I I'm probably not there's still one more City I could get but I'm 
running out of gold at this point but then again   I think has he passed at this point if he has then 
I could just pick up the last City placement bonus   at the start of the Next Generation because 
I know I'm gonna start the next Generation so   that could also be a thing I'm thinking about   this makes a lot of sense just get just get 
a little bit of extra Mega Credits why not   the heat is closed anyway oh and now my opponent 
has started the miner I'm not happy about that I was too greedy great escapement Consortium could be an 
idea just to contest him in the miner but so this one I okay yeah normally this is like you 
should watch this tile like as a Greenery so yeah   I'm I'm thinking about putting in here but I'm 
like no no this is gonna be four next to four   cities of course it's better but um it's it's it 
basically gives you VP I'm talking about the uh the tilejust played what's it 
called commercial District I think   so the kind of gives you VP just like a Greenery 
does except that it also works on enemy cities so   normally you want to place this tile next to a 
lot of enemy cities but but in this case I could   place it next to to three of my own cities 
and the Land Claim City so there's there's   no places on the map where I could put it next 
to 2 enemy cities so I think this makes sense [Music] I still haven't played insects   is it is it the case okay now he's passed 
I'm sure of it no he's not are you passing did he pass yeah there we go now he's 
passed and I'm like all right now we   can place two greeneries and let's go to 14 
Generations yeah yeah and then what I think   is gonna happen is it's gonna be an absolute 
race right now in the in the Next Generation   it's gonna be a race to just get as much 
stuff on the on the map as possible like because I have I'm gonna have 67 plants next 
generation so that's like seven or eight eight   or nine Greeneries right there and I'm gonna 
have so much gold so I can place even more and I also god   Greenhouses Jesus Christ so what did I just play I could just sell two 
cards and still play Insects no actually I   can just uh no I can't I can't make a 
Greenery because then the game closes   but I can still I'm selling two 
cards probably so I'm getting it   but at this point I don't know can I even 
place all these greeneries not sure but uh   probably also for the memes 32 plant production 
let's go [Laughter] that's a lot of plants! [Music] technically CEO's favorite project 
I could be picking up media archives   or something or no what's it called the 
one that gives you three gold when you   play an event so (Media Group) that's 
probably why I haven't played it yet   media is something I can't remember 
(Media group Boneless jeez) so yeah right now   I'm very sad about him starting Miner I'm just 
checking I'm like oh frog I I can't get this so Rover construction once again a bit greedy   I think I should have recognized that I'm gonna 
end the game with with too much Mega credits like   an excess of mega credits I'm gonna end 
the game having like 30 Mega credits so   playing stuff like Rover construction it's not 
even good at this point like the only the only   thing I have to do right now is to fill up the 
map as soon as possible anything else is a misplay of course if uh this is a misplay why am 
I doing this I have a Land Claim I'm not   seeing the writing on the wall like it's it's 
it's desperately important that I fill out the   map before my opponent does even though it gives 
me greeneries greeneries next to my city doesn't   matter the map is going to fill up I have 
to just spend my 77 plants Boneless please   fill up the map I'm starting the 
last two Awards because I don't   want to mess up again but even this 
it's a mistake this is also a mistake   getting getting cards like it's it shouldn't be a 
priority right now this can wait fill up the map and also I only have eight minutes left so 
I'm a little bit stressed about time I think   am I finally realizing it it's 
uh it took me long enough I think yeah I'm finally starting to spend it probably didn't occur to me that that the 
map is gonna be completely filled up but oh this bug man when you play 
greeneries too fast uh you can't do it so now I have to skip a turn and now my opponent 
is gonna start filling up and I'm gonna feel bad   yeah I'm gonna feel bad about this bug here 
but to be fair uh I have maybe I looked at   my opponent at least I should but you can 
also make make a have an idea of how many   greeneries your opponent is actually gonna 
gonna place but uh yeah looking this back um it's of course much easier to just point 
out my mistakes after the fact when I'm not   like super stressed for time but the uh 
looking at this after the fact especially   with the knowledge that I'm gonna end up 
having a lot of Mega credits over yeah it's   the start of this generation should 
have been to just fill up the planet yes   I wasted a bunch of actions doing other things it 
shouldn't be a priority this is a priority [Music]   but to be fair probably it didn't matter like my 
opponent sooner or later he would have probably   taken the the few placement bonuses he had 
available to him anyway so Ants Ants yes nice okay so now I can relax a little bit more now the   but it's a little bit sad right because I have 32 
plant production and nothing to spend it with so   you could argue that the uh like even insects in 
the last generation I think it was still of course   worth it because I have decomposers and ecological 
Zone and also it ends up saving me a lot of Mega   credits because I don't have to actually spend 
my mega credits on greeneries now that I played   insects I just had just enough plants to do 
it with only plants and not Mega Credits but yeah yeah probably I should have taken the 
ghg um the one that makes microbes into   heat but doesn't matter at this point 
I cannot fill up tardigrades anyway [Music]   fish get a fish nice I don't know the 
picture of of a bear eating a cow it's   just a little bit too brutal for me I think 
it it makes more sense that he eats a fish I could be wrong of course physics complex 
another card I want oh yeah of course this is   why I haven't played uh CEO's favorite project 
yet I haven't played physics complex oh I see   yeah so definitely this is why so I was 
wondering why I hadn't played uh this is   why you you wait until the last generation before 
you play cards that only gives you Victory point   because they could increase in value somehow 
so definitely the right call to not play uh   CEO's favorite Project yet because I could 
technically pick up what I just picked up   the one that gives me physics 
complex the one that gives me a   two points per science resource so so this is what 
I I want to combo with the CEO's favorite project   playing animals here in the last round 
is fine but this only gives me half an   animal but this is still gonna give me 
one point because I have viral enhancers   um so this is definitely where my 
head is at right now I'm just gonna   figure out what gives me Point normally I would 
figure out how to spend my money the best but   right at this point I'm realizing oh poop I 
have too much money there's a I've messed up yeah this is like let's go 11 predators Mars is going to be a very 
very dangerous place to be yeah there we go physics complex this Miner really annoys me he's gonna have   six plus seven how the hell 
did he get so much what the I'm not happy about that not happy at all but it is what it is and to be fair I mean   we don't really care about high scores in 
Terraforming Mars I don't think so it's   just me being a little bit annoyed that I could 
have played better that's probably what it is selling my cards I like this play just in 
case that we are equal then in VP when the   game is over if we are at the same VP then 
it's actually going to be the gold that   decides the game so just in case I'm being 
ironic of course that's that's like no way   froging in hell I I lose this game so I 
don't know why I sell my cards but yeah but I think I'm gonna have like uh this one maybe 
one more maybe three at the most when I have these   God games and then I'm gonna the other games that 
I'm gonna show you is gonna be uh when I go for   some different strategies probably more fun to 
to see some of that stuff as well so uh yeah   uh thanks for watching and I hope this was uh 
okay even though it's a bit uh stressed bye-bye
