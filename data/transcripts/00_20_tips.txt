Here are 20 "quick" tips to help you win 
Terraforming Mars if you want to there's   a much longer version of this on my channel 
believe it or not this is actually the short   version tip number one realize that this is an 
engine building game and play accordingly so   this means engine first VP later so generally 
speaking there are two ways of doing this you   can go for money income which is Mega-credit 
Productions Steel-production Titanium-production   also a little bit of TR something like this so 
this is the approach for long games but if it's   in your best interest to close the game as soon 
as possible you can also build your engine with   primarily Heat-production and Terraform Rating we 
could say that the top half of the screen here is   like the greedy engine which tends to be better 
for long games and then you could argue that the   bottom half of the screen is like the Tempo-engine 
better for short games better for the terraformers   and I really want to make clear here that this is 
like extremely oversimplified like even if you're   going for the tempo-engine you'll probably still 
play Acquired Company still play Titanium Mine   you'll probably even still play Business Empire 
or the Mine something like this and likewise even   if you are playing the greedy engine you can still 
play some of the stuff in the bottom of the screen   other examples of tempo engine cards could be 
Nitrogen-rich asteroid I could be Towing a Comet   Towing a Comet is actually kind of cool because 
what you do is you wait until you have exactly   four plants and then you make them water on top of 
two plants because then you have a total of eight   plants and then as your second action you'll build 
a Greenery immediately and of course if you are   going for the Tempo engine if you are going for TR 
to some extent then of course stuff like Soletta   and Mohole Area these are very good cards in this 
case regardless of what you might have heard me   say in the past then it's also great to get some 
card-draw I think these three cards here they're   really good I would almost always keep these three 
but getting back to card-draw in general I think   card-draw tends to be better in long games in 
terms of generations which means that card draw   in general is a little bit better in two or three 
player games card-draw is to some extent part of   the greedy card strategy it is like by the very 
nature a bit greedy and completely ruins your   Tempo so Tempo is very important when you're going 
for terraforming so the point I'm trying to make   is if you're rushing then card draw is a little 
bit risky to pick up because then Tempo might   be more important for you than the card draw 
a random card is worth around 3 Mega-credits   a random card and a two-player game specifically 
is worth around 4 Mega credits and the reason for   this is that in these long greedy two player games 
the primary strategy is the greedy card strategy   if you're going for the greedy game then the best 
approach is to get both money income and card-draw   if you can get a balance of both then you can go 
truly GODMODE and even though I say money income   and card-draw that's really good actually Card 
discount Plus Card-Draw that's even better this   can get truly out of control a TR is worth like 
exactly the same as one VP plus one Mega credit   production this is useful information because 
this will help you to evaluate cards so now we   know that nuclear zone for instance well that's 
exactly the same as two mega-credit production   and a placement bonus which is actually not too 
bad for building an engine as a rule of thumb   one Terraform Rating is worth 8 Mega credits 
unless you want to close the game really badly   in that case you could make the argument that 
it's like 9 or 10 mega credits or something   but if we really don't care about this boring 
aspect of closing the game early then I think   one terraform rating is worth eight this is true 
for the first generation and it's true for the   last generation here is a graph of what I think 
everything is worth depending on which generation   we are talking about and I've come to realize 
that this graph here is mostly reflecting the   greedy approach to Terraforming Mars but if you 
are playing a temper engine or maybe just for the   average player in general then I think you could 
add one to all the VP and all the terraform rating   in this graph and also you could lower the mega 
credit production just a little bit but you know   what these values here are much easier to remember 
these are probably the values to live by so in the   first generation one terraform rating is around 8 
1vp is around three and one Mega credit production   is around 5 unless you predict it's going to be a 
super fast game in that case I would argue that a   mega credit production is worth around 4 then in 
the last generation one terraform rating is still   8 and then one VP is also 8 and then Mega credit 
production is useless in the last generation tip   number two in the early game you need to focus 
on climbing out of their hole first of all you do   this by getting a little bit of money income you 
can also get a little bit of TR for the purposes   of engine building one TR is also kind of worth 
one Mega credit production I think it's always a   good idea to get plus 10 money income as soon as 
possible in Long games you need even more because   then you need a huge engine and in short games 
in really fast games you could make the argument   that you can make due with a little less engine 
the point is the game is really hard to play if   you don't have any engine at all if you aim to 
close the game super early you can also build your   engine with TR and Heat-production five player 
games specifically might be really short in terms   of generations so in these games you might even 
consider VP and especially TR as soon as maybe the   first generation tip number 2.5 engine building 
cards should be able to pay for themselves in   five or fewer Generations now we also come back to 
this idea that the value of Mega credit production   depends on how long the game is going to last 
in terms of generations so if you're predict the   game is going to be super fast then mega credit 
production is worth a little bit less and finally   you should keep in mind that this rule about five 
or fewer Generations this only apply to the first   generation the further we get into the game the 
faster card must be able to pay for itself if you   do not climb out of the hole then the hole might 
become a black hole tip number three in the mid to   late game make the transition from engine to VP 
grabbing this is equally as important as engine   building is so I kind of want to start grabbing 
VP when there are around four generations left   and pure Victory Point cards should be played in 
the last generation tip number four play to grab   the bonuses on the Global parameters so these 
are the bonuses that I'm talking about so what   can you actually do to get these bonuses first 
of all you can just keep the right card so I'm   talking about cards that just like Leap-frogs you 
like two or three steps off of a global parameter   so for instance we got Deimos Down or we got 
giant solar shade or it could be strip mine   secondly do not give your opponents an easy way to 
claim the bonus if you just leave the bonus there   with like one or two steps until the bonus then 
there's a pretty high likelihood that someone else   would claim the bonus before you and thirdly you 
want to plan your actions carefully when you're   getting close to a bonus and finally if you are 
the first player in the upcoming generation you   can actually set yourself up to claim the bonus 
in the start of the Next Generation and the reason   for this is that if you end this generation and 
also start the upcoming Generations you will have   a lot of actions in a row and you can really use 
this to get the bonuses amongst other things tip   number five if you want to prioritize milestones 
in shorter games 4- and 5-player games in Long   games they are less important 2- or 3-player 
games and just to get the awards out of the   way the first award you should claim like sort 
of in the early- to midgame but I want to stress   this only if you're really sure you're gonna win 
it otherwise it's not worth it I mean it's only   eight Mega credits so if you're really sure 
you'll get at the very least the second place   okay maybe it's worth it but as a general rule 
you really don't want to start an Award unless   you're very confident you're gonna win it the 
second award that costs 14 you kind of want to   start this in the midgame and the last award 
that costs 20 this one is not that important   I'm okay with starting this in the late game or 
maybe in the very last generation something like   this but getting back to the Milestones here are 
the Milestones that I'm talking about during the   early game you always want to have milestones 
in mind and you should always aim to get one   of the milestones at least but I think there is a 
little bit of wiggle room here regarding when to   actually pick up the Milestones so in a two-player 
game you want to fight for the Milestones around   generation 5 in a three player game you want to 
fight for the Milestones around Generation 4 in   a four player game you want to fight for the 
milestone around generation 3 and finally in   the five player game you want to fight for the 
Milestones as soon as possible in a five play   game it is actually a Race So the basic idea here 
is that in five player games the scores are much   lower because there are fewer Generations which 
also means that the Milestones are just that much   more important because it's like a bigger part 
of your score if that makes sense on the other   hand in two player games the scores are going to 
be a lot bigger which means that in two player   games the Milestones are not that important I 
mean it's still nice if you can get them but   you don't really have to rush to get all of them 
tip number 5.5 don't make too many bad plays just   so you can get a milestone instead rather go for 
the Milestones that Naturally Fit your game so if   you're Tharsis naturally you'll gravitate toward 
the Mayor milestone and maybe even the Gardner   Milestone and if you're terraforming like crazy 
maybe you're Unmi or something then naturally you   go for the terraformer Milestone and to be honest 
that's probably the only Milestone you're gonna   get this game but that's fine tip number six don't 
buy a Milestone before an opponent is exactly   three actions away from buying it or technically 
maybe three accidents away from claiming the last   available spot if you can wait before claiming 
a milestone then you should wait and the reason   for this is that Mega Credit in the early game 
is worth a lot more than Mega credits later on   in the game so for instance the eight Mega credits 
you spend on a milestone in the early game this is   actually a huge chunk of your economy this could 
have gone into like engine building or something   else like in one of the games on my channel I 
played against a Tharsis player who just built   three cities immediately through his Corporation 
and preludes and then immediately he just got the   Mayor Milestone and I was like ah I like the 
three cities it's not great but it's not bad   it's okay but when you get the mayor Milestone 
immediately that's so unnecessary you can wait   like several generations before you have to pick 
up this Milestone tip number seven you should   plan out your generation you should do the math 
you don't really have to but it definitely helps   for instance if you have a really expensive 
card you want to play in the Next Generation   because you cannot afford it right now then you 
should really do the math because then you know   how much Mega credits you can actually afford 
to spend in this generation so some example of   this really expensive cards you might want to save 
up for could be Earth elevator it could be giant   solar shade or it could be Io Mining Industries so 
here are a few examples of math that I do in most   of my games so the first one is all about what 
do I want to play in this upcoming generation   so I take my current Mega credits plus my mega 
credit production minus whatever Mega credit I   plan on spending in the Next Generation also steel 
and titanium and stuff are implied in this case   and all of this should add up to at least zero but 
ideally it should be 9 or 12 and the whole reason   for this is that this is all about how many cards 
can actually afford to buy in the research phase   so if it adds up to nine if it adds up to six then 
I know I have to restrict myself to only buying   two or three cards the second piece of math I do 
is just to calculate how many generations before a   card will pay for itself and then you really have 
to take into account like I mentioned how many   generations do I think is left in the game and 
in the lategame is simply calculate which of my   available plays will give the most VP is a better 
to play the cards on my hand or is it better just   to start spamming cities and greeneries so do 
you need to do all of this math no does it help   to do all of this math yeah tip number eight 
should I aim for a greedy long game or should   I aim for a short TR-heavy game so let's look at 
how long a game of terraforming Mars is actually   going to last in terms of generations so if 
you're playing with preludes which you should   preludes is amazing the two player games will 
last mostly around 9 to 12 Generations whereas 5   player games will last mostly 6 to 9 Generations 
so these are the average number of generations   across all players but it really depends on the 
meta because players who enjoys having fun with   their greedy engine hello they will likely have 
longer games so for people like me who enjoys the   greedy games it's not unheard of that the games 
goes to 11 or 12 or 13 generations and then you   might be thinking well well the other guy can just 
close it but the two player games is not that easy   but this is a little bit of a self-fulfilling 
prophecy right because I enjoy greedy games so   most of my games are gonna be greedy especially 
two player games but then if another guy enjoys   like going really like super fast games then most 
of these games is going to be super fast right and   speaking of those guys I should mention that the 
top ranked players will have super fast games it   comes down to that they are more efficient in just 
getting everything done a little bit sooner and   also it's just the meta right The Meta in these 
top 100 ranked games is just that the game ends   at bit sooner and then we're kind of back to the 
self-fulfilling prophecy that if the meta in these   high games are just super fast then the best 
strategy is to be super fast tip number 8.5 in   two or three player games aim to play the greedy 
card strategy every single game this comes down   to the fact that two or three player games tends 
to be longer in terms of generations which means   you can get away with more greed but I thought 
about this some more and I realized that this   also kind of depends on the meta it depends on 
how fast your opponents want to close the game   so after taking this into consideration I think 
this is a more accurate way to look at it in games   that last 10 plus generation you should aim to 
play the greedy card strategy every single time   so in 10 Generations I think it's a little bit of 
a draw I think the greedy card strategy could win   and also the terraformer could win but if you go 
to generation 11 or more I think the greedy card   strategy has a higher likelihood of winning and 
then you might be thinking well when I start a   game I don't really know how many generations 
the game is going to last and while this is   true there's still a bunch of things you can do to 
actually try to identify this first of all number   of players is good indication the fewer number 
of players you are the long longer the game is   going to last in terms of generations secondly 
you can try to take into account The Meta like   the opponents you're playing against these guys 
do they enjoy long games or do they enjoy short   TR heavy games and thirdly around generation 
2 or 3 you should have a pretty good idea if   you look at enemy plant-product in an enemy 
Heat-production especially you should have   a pretty good idea of what they are trying to do 
and how many generations the game is going to last   the greedy card-strategy can also work in four to 
five play games but it is a lot more risky in four   to five player games the terraformers or you could 
also say the tempo engines these type of guys have   a higher likelihood of beating you just because 
of the fact that the games tend to be shorter in   terms of generations having all of this in the 
back of your head is very useful but ultimately   what it comes down to is you have to play with the 
cards you get tip number nine get Heat-production   in the early to mid game or if you are a really 
greedy guy like me who enjoys long games then   maybe just never get it at all the point is 
Heat-production is not that efficient when it   comes to building your engine and plant-production 
is actually even worse I'll get back to that but   of course if you are going for the tempo engine 
if you want to close the game Super fast then of   course go for it Heat-production is good in that 
case so what is a heat production actually worth   in the earlygame it's worth around 5 Mega credits 
which is the same as a mega-credit-production also   around 5 Mega-credits but if you're going for the 
really fast game if it's in your best interest to   close the game as soon as possible then of course 
you could argue that it's worth a little bit more   than five Mega-credits I think I nailed the 
main difference between Heat-production and   plant-production so Plant-production is always 
good regardless of your strategy Heat-production   is always fine but it's kinda a lot better if 
you're going for the TR strategy if you want to   close the game control the game and since this 
is a logic we're using we could also flip the   coin and say if you're the greedy guy you got the 
big engine you want the game to drag out for as   long as possible in that case you should only 
get Heat-production if it's a really good deal   if you get some discount or something or maybe 
you already can see that Heat is not the last   parameter to close in that case Heat-production 
is still fine when is Heat-production actually   good one you play early initially my thought about 
Heat-production is that it is better if you want   to close the game but then I spoke to this former 
rank one player on Steam and he actually said that   it is also good if you want to control the game 
and when he's talking about controlling the game   what he means is that it actually has some value 
just to have the opportunity to be able to close   the game faster depending how it all goes and 
while it's not always the temperature that's   the last parameter to close it is kind of true 
that the amount of Heat-production around the   table actually kind of dictates how long the 
game is going to go so if you want to be one   of the guys who has a little more influence 
in which generation the game is gonna close   then Heat-production is good but you could argue 
this is a minor thing to be honest mainly what   you want to remember is that if you are trying 
to close the game then Heat-production is good   and finally if you're getting a really good deal 
on Heat-production maybe you have some discount   or you could have a Heat-combo so the point here 
is that Heat-production is a lot worse once the   parameter is maxed which is why it's really good 
to have stuff like Meltworks Helion Caretaker   Contract Insulation and this is of course assuming 
that Heat-production is not the last parameter to   close because if it is the last parameter to close 
then you're fine either way then I also put in   Optimal Aerobraking and Media Group and I just 
feel like these cards are often very good with   these cheap Heat-production space event cards Tip 
number 10 get Plant-production in the mid game or   at the very least after you've built an engine of 
some kind Plant-production is always good like no   matter what strategy you're going for however 
it's a very bad way of building your engine   which is why I think the sweet spot for when to 
get plant-production is exactly in the midgame   because if you think about it one Greenery is kind 
of worth like three victory points one Victory   point for the greenery one TR for the oxygen and 
one VP next to your city it could be a little bit   more it could be a little bit less but the point 
here is there's not a lot of engine building here   is there it's only like one TR for the oxygen 
that's the only engine building you're getting   out of this the thing to keep in mind is that 
plants and greeneries are mainly a way to get   victory points in fact I would go so far as to 
say that having one or two plant production in   the early game is just straight up bad unless of 
course maybe you have a plan to actually convert   your plants into Greenery in this generation or 
the Next Generation maybe you're intending to   get plants off of placement bonuses or something 
so you can convert pretty soonish in that case   you can be excused but generally speaking having 
one or two playing production in the early game   is bad it and here is why so the first reason 
is that this is money you could have spent an   engine instead and also early Plant-Production 
tend to be really expensive it's a lot cheaper   later on once the requirements gets met but in the 
earlygame it's very expensive secondly if you only   have one or two plant-production then it will take 
you like four generations just to get one Greenery   down and even that one Greenery is only gonna be 
worth one money income and the third reason is   this guy if it takes you that many generations 
just to get one Greenery down then chances are   someone will have burned your plants before you 
get to that point here are some plant-amplifiers   you could be considering except for maybe worms 
all of these are great cards and if you are going   for plant-production it could also make sense 
that you're going for Green Tag Synergy Green   Tag Synergy can actually give you a lot of points 
especially if you're going for the long game a   card like Meat Industry can get completely out of 
control if you're going for animals so you could   make the argument that plant-production goes hand 
in hand with green tag Synergy but then again you   could also make the argument that plant-production 
goes hand in hand with this city-strategy so   generally speaking plant-production is better to 
play in the midgame but naturally if you get some   of these insane lategame plant-production cards of 
course you also play some of these and in the last   generation all of a sudden Plant-production 
is good again because in the last generation   is all about getting eight plants so you can 
make a Greenery in the extra round so in the   last generation you kind of want to play to 
make your plants plus plant-production equal   to 8 or 16 plants or maybe a little bit more than 
this and the reason is this guy so maybe this guy   hasn't had the time to play Birds earlier maybe 
just picked it up or maybe it just deliberately   kept it in his hand just to grief you in the last 
generation just to make sure that you cannot build   an extra Greenery in the extra round and this can 
of course be really annoying which is why it could   be a good idea to keep just a little bit of extra 
plants just in case but actually the biggest thing   you could do to counter this is to slow-play in 
the last generation we'll talk more about this in   tip number 14 but basically the point is that if 
you pass the generation and he plays Birds there's   nothing you can do but if he plays Birds and 
you still have a few actions left maybe there's   something you could do to actually counter this 
maybe you can get a placement bonus or maybe you   have a card with a few plants on it or something 
tip number 11 buy colonies is especially Luna and   Pluto even if it is with the standard project 
for 17 you know what this standard project is   actually often good enough in the earlygame 
(also mid/lategame) and of course if you get   some of these Colony cards I would be even more 
inclined to go for colonies these cards are good   I would be happy to see most of these cards in my 
opening hand here are the colonies in the early   game you're probably looking for some income it 
could be Ceres or Luna Pluto is also really good   if you're going for the Tempo-engine stuff like 
IO and Ganymede are of course also good choices   and in the mid to late game if you just want to 
get a bunch of points you go for Enceladus Titan   and especially Miranda to be honest all of these 
colonies are actually really good it just depends   on the situation as it is with all card-draw 
Pluto is a little bit better if you have an   engine to support it like if you have no engine 
at all it's actually a little hard to justify   spending 17 just to get Pluto to get some cards 
but if you do have a lot of money income then   Pluto is straight up the best colony and in the 
first generation if you do have the choice between   playing a colony on Luna for 17 or playing some 
some sub-optimal card of some sort and of course   I would prefer Luna every single time imagine if 
you will in your opening hand you have a card that   you played three to buy so it costs 14 and gives 
you three Mega-credit-production maybe a little   bit more than three Mega-credit-production that's 
pretty good that's basically Luna but once again   it must be said that mega-credit-production in 
general is better if you expect the game to go   long but if you expect the game to be over in 
six Generations then Luna is maybe not worth it   also of course it depends on what other cards you 
have in your opening hand maybe you have something   better tip number 11.5 in most cases you want to 
buy a colony as your first action and then trade   there immediately as your second action the only 
scenario I can think of where you buy a colony and   don't trade there immediately it must be because 
that you're anticipating someone else to trade   there right now or maybe you just desperately want 
the last available spot on that Colony tip number   12 if you are playing with colonies you want to 
get three energy production as soon as possible   it's a little hard to explain but it is somehow 
just a lot cheaper to trade with three energy   compared to three Titanium or nine Mega credits 
here are some different ways you can get energy   production in the early game you kind of don't 
want to buy too many of these power plants for   11 but you know if you have two energy production 
and you can get the third by buying a power plant   go for it tip number 13 some things are better to 
do at the start of a generation and some things   are better to do at the end of a generation so 
here are some examples of stuff you want to do   as soon as possible in a generation so this could 
be Milestones or Awards it could be getting the   last few available TR if the parameter is about 
to close it could be getting the best placement   bonuses on the map it could be claiming a bonus 
also on the global parameters it could be spending   your plants before you actually get hit by a 
comet (not comment lol) so once again that's   because of this guy could also be Attack cards 
and it could also be Effect-cards that gives   you X when opponents does Y so I'm talking about 
Pets I'm talking about Immigrant City stuff like   this here's some stuff you want to do as late 
as possible in a generation so for instance   you want to play cards and use actions where you 
get X based on opponents Y so that's not the same   as I just mentioned because what we mentioned 
before was effects this is basically the rest   now I'm talking toll station I'm talking Galilean 
Waystation I'm talking Martian rails so these are   the type of cards that benefit from you waiting 
for as long as possible before playing it so for   instance greenhouses why would you play this 
at the start of the generation maybe during   the generation someone will build a city so you 
play this as late as possible and obviously when   we're talking greenhouses and Martian rails and 
stuff like this it's not actually the last thing   you do in a generation it's like the second to 
last thing you do in a generation because the   last thing should be to spend the plants or 
spend the mega credits you get from actually   using these cards other things you want to do as 
late as possible in a generation for example you   want to make plays to set yourself up to win a 
race at the beginning at the upcoming generation   you want to terraform with action cards and heat 
resources also as late as possible you want to   decrease enemy energy production if they're using 
it to trade or power and action card or something   like this so basically if an opponent has exactly 
one energy production you probably want to steal   that as soon as possible but if he has three and 
he's using these three energy production to trade   if he's played an action card or something that 
uses energy and you can see woaw he has exactly   the energy he needs to use this action card in the 
Next Generation then you actually want to steal it   as late as possible because this way you could 
do the most damage because then he's got to pass   the generation and then you steal it and then he 
is like "arrh I needed that energy to trade" and   then there's nothing he can do about it and also 
if an opponent has Predators you want to make   animals as late as possible in the generation 
or maybe not at all it kind of depends right   it could be that someone else around the table 
also has an animal card and maybe the Predator   will then steal from that guy instead of you 
because maybe you have zero animals on your   card this doesn't happen very often but it's just 
a thing to keep in mind tip number 14 you want to   spend only one action on your turn unless you 
have a reason to actually spend two actions why   is it better to generally only spend one action on 
your turn first of all your opponents kind of show   their hand before you do and it also gives you 
essentially more actions in a row so why is it   better to have many actions in a row for example 
you can surprise claim a milestone you can claim   the bonuses without being contested on the global 
parameters and it's more like things under your   control if that makes sense that's just a lot of 
scenarios that will benefit you if you do not show   your hand before your opponents and there are a 
bunch of exceptions to this rule so it could be   for instance that the players around the table 
maybe just prefer that you take two actions on   your turn maybe you're playing casually 
or something like this some groups prefer   it like this it could be that there's some lot 
of race going on so maybe if you're like close   to getting a milestone oh the other guy is also 
close to getting a milestone I just have to beat   that guy to get the Milestone something like this 
could also be setting yourself up to get a better   placement bonus on the map so for example if you 
play a city and then immediately you want to play   Greenery next to the city and maybe also next to 
water or something also in most cases if you're   building a colony You Want To Build The Colony 
as the first action and then trade immediately   as the second action also if you have exactly zero 
energy-production it's a good idea to play around   energy tapping and power supply Consortium 
so you do this by actually making the energy   as your first action and then you spend energy 
immediately as your second action could also be   that you acquire plants as your first action and 
then you build a Greenery immediately as a second   action so this is how you play around asteroids 
could also be that you just have one thing you   want to do this generation and then you just 
spend all your mega credits titanium and steel   immediately because this way you play around 
sabotage air raid and hired Raiders but it's   basically only if you have one big expensive card 
like Io Mining Industries or something tip number   14.5 in the last generation it is especially 
important to only you take one action on your   turn so why is this a little bit extra important 
in the last generation first of all what if it's   not the last generation it could be the case that 
your opponents are surprise-closing the game but   it could also be the case that he's surprise-not 
closing the game which can be equally devastating   slow playing is also crucial for fighting for 
awards so for example do I have a mega-credit   production card in my hand maybe I want to keep 
that for as long as possible because maybe someone   is gonna contest me in the banker or something 
it was kind of nice to know do I have to actually   play this useless card in the last generation 
that does nothing for me except giving me a   mega-credit-production or can I afford selling 
this and spend my mega credits on something   better or something that gives me a point for 
example could also be that someone started the   miner and you're actually winning the miner but 
you're only winning it if you're not spending   your resources in that case is also really 
beneficial for you if the other guy actually   passes before you because then you know exactly 
how much steel and titanium you can actually   spend on your Jovian amplifiers or something like 
this while still winning the miner also if you   pass the last generation before your opponent 
they might remove your plants/plant-production   preventing you from making that plus one Greenery 
so we're back to this guy this is really annoying   if you pass before your opponent then you're more 
vulnerable to a card like birds or something like   this and if you yourself is actually the bird 
person then it's the same deal right you want   to wait for as long as possible before removing 
enemy plants or Plant-production because if the   opponent has passed then you can actually just 
count how many plants he can make the extra round   and you can know if you can actually grief him 
by playing birds secondly if he already passed   the generation well then there's nothing he can do 
about it so basically in the last generation it's   an advantage if you are the last guy to pass the 
last generation so basically what I'm saying is   you shall not pass the last generation before 
your opponents if possible so keeping this in   mind you could also say that there's a little bit 
of an advantage to actually have a lot of action   cards and stuff like this because it'll give you 
a small Advantage in the last generation could   also be that the temperature parameter is maxed 
and you still have a bunch of Heat left over well   you can actually just slow play by making eight 
heat into absolutely nothing and then pass the   turn it's a little bit frowned upon to be honest 
you have to be some sort of autist to actually   do this but it's something you can do so when it's 
better to actually take two actions on turn in the   last generation generally this is only something 
you do right at the start of the last generation   if you want to do it so maybe you're in a rush to 
start the last award maybe you're in a rush to get   the last few available TR before the parameter 
closes completely or maybe you want one of the   good placement bonuses on the map or just any 
placement bonus at all maybe the map is filling   up completely tip number 15 card sequence do not 
play a card until you need it for something so   generally speaking engine building cards should 
be played in the early- to midgame and pure VP   cards should be played in the last generation so 
why is it that some cards are better if you play   them later on first of all Mega-credits is worth 
more in the earlygame compared to the lategame so   this is why you don't want to play a pure VP card 
in the first generation it does nothing for you   it doesn't build your engine in any way and also 
during the game perhaps the cards become cheaper   because you pick up discount-cards so these 
are the discount-cards I'm talking about so   why would you play some card that does nothing 
for you except give you VP in the early game   when you could just wait for the entire game and 
then you pick up some discount on that you could   play for cheaper in the last generation also 
some cards are simply worth more if you play   them later I'll get back to that in the next tip 
and finally you kind of don't want to show your   hand until you absolutely have to so for example 
Jovian amplifiers you kind of don't want to play   these cards until the last generation except for 
Io Mining Industries so this is basically because   it's only VP but it's also because then you're 
giving away the fact that you are indeed going   for jovians this game so if you're going for 
Drafting and people already know that you're   going for jovians because you maybe you played 
water import from a Europe or something well then   they're not gonna pass you so many jovians in 
the drafting phase right could also be VENUSIAN   ANIMALS <3 so if you're playing this card too 
early then you're kind of giving away the fact   that you're going for science this game and then 
people are less likely to pass your science tags   in the drafting phase so you really don't want 
to play a card until you have a reason to do   so so you want to play colonizer training camp as 
late as possible but still within the five oxygen   requirements so this could be when the oxygen 
is like three to five or something don't play   ecological zone or decomposers until you plan on 
playing a green tag next don't play herbivores   until you plan on placing greeneries and once 
again don't play Venusian Animals until you   plan on playing a science tag next so basically 
what I'm saying is you must have a clear reason   to play the card that you're about to play if the 
reason is nothing except for VP then you should   play it in the last generation tip number 16 some 
cards are potentially worth more when played later   on the biggest examples that come to mind are 
science tags and green tags so for example if   you got Research this gives you like two cards and 
one Victory point just this card alone but then if   you also have Olympus conference Mars University 
and venusian animals then all of a sudden research   just this card gives you three cards a rotation of 
two cards and three victory points another example   is Advanced Ecosystem by itself this card just 
gives you 3 VP but if you don't play it until   the last generation and then during the game you 
picked up while enhancers decomposes ecological   Zone then all of a sudden this card alone is worth 
three plants and five victory points so in 99 out   of 100 cases you wanna play Advanced Ecosystems 
in the last generation and also there are a few   cards here that just gets better the later in the 
game you actually play them so generally speaking   you also want to play these as late as possible 
but it's not quite like this because sometimes   you just need the plant or the mega-credits 
right here right now to make an amazing play   and then of course you want to play these a bit 
sooner in that case and tip number 17 you want to   play to maximize resource amplifiers they can be 
really good sometimes they're just straight up win   you the game but of course by nature these are 
very situational so what you do is you pick up   a resource amplifier like one of these cards and 
then you try to figure out can I make this work   in my game does it align with the plan I have so 
most of the time these just give you like average   value you play it and you're like all right that's 
fine some of the time they're completely useless   maybe you don't have one Earth tag in this game 
why would you pick up Cartel and sometimes they   just straight up win you the game sometimes 
you get 10 mega credit production from playing   satellites or if it's a four or five player game 
especially toll station is insane something like   this so when you see these cards you just have 
to make an assessment is this the perfect card   for this game that I'm playing right now like if 
you have a bunch of green tags and then you just   topdeck insects it can be incredibly powerful 
so just keep your eye out for these cards and   naturally if you have stuff like insects cartel 
satellites you should maximize the value of these   cards by playing as many tags as possible before 
you're playing these cards but also keep in mind   the production is better the earlier you get it 
really depends on how many generations the game   is going to last and stuff like this tip number 18 
you want to play the Good cards taken into account   the number of players in the game because some 
cards are really good in two player games and   other cards are really good in five player games 
so for example Attack cards the card with the   red border I would argue that these are slightly 
better in two player games why because then you're   damaging a hundred percent of your opponents and 
also if someone retaliates well you're only two   player so he's only gonna retaliate and you also 
the really greedy cards they tend to be better in   two-player games as well so for example we got AI 
Central anti-gravity technology and interplanetary   trade these cards can be very powerful but it does 
take a lot of time to set this up so what I mean   is if you play this in a five player game maybe 
the game is just gonna be over before you actually   benefit from these cards so this is why generally 
speaking these cards tend to be a bit stronger in   two or three player games simply because there's 
gonna be more Generations just because you're only   two players and then you can get the conditions 
where these cards can really shine because you   want to benefit from having these cards for like 
a lot of generations so definitely these cards   are just better in longer games which is why 
they're better in two player games and also for   the same reason in these long drawn out two-player 
games the card-draw cards are just really good as   well because the go-to strategy in two player 
games is the card strategy and it makes sense   the more Generations you have the more cards 
you can draw and especially the more of these   new cards you can actually get to play in these 
long games so let's go in the other direction   and talk about five player games so I think these 
cards here are a little bit better in five player   games so we're talking Tharsis Poseidon and 
Toll station Quantum communications Galilean   waystation it's worth noting that a corporation 
like Poseidon is still good in two player games   it's just a solid corporation but it is a little 
bit better than five player games so to a lesser   extent I would also argue that city-synergetic 
cards are also generally a little bit better in   four or five player games but this one is not as 
clear because in some two-player games there are   more cities being played than in 5 player games 
but statistically speaking these cards are just   a little bit better than five player games and 
in four or five player games people also tend to   favor TR a little bit more and it makes sense 
because in five play games it's gonna be very   short so you want some engine you want some VP as 
soon as possible and TR just you both tip number   19 don't be afraid to use standard projects 
but use them wisely so first of all standard   technology makes all the standard projects better 
especially the colony standard project in the   early game but that being said let's assume we 
don't have standard technology so generally the   way the game works is that the card is always 
more efficient than the standard projects but   sometimes you don't have the right card for the 
situation so let's go through them real quickly   so we got Sell Patents well generally you should 
sell when necessary even if it is a card you paid   three Mega credit for but the thing is you kind 
of don't want to sell your cards until you need   that plus one Mega credit because your cards could 
end up being worthwhile because maybe the bad card   on your hand just have the tag you need all of a 
sudden or maybe you get some discount to make the   card worth it could also be the case that you just 
need bad cards in your hand to cycle it could be   because of Mars University Sponsored Academies or 
Pluto and then we got the power plant well if you   need it you need it it is a bit expensive to pay 
11 Mega credits just to get one energy-production   but it could be the case to just have a card or 
you want to set yourself up to trade or something   so in a lot of cases you actually do buy this 
and then we've got asteroid and Air Scrapping   and these two standard projects are generally the 
worst in the game so basically you'll never want   to play asteroid unless well maybe you can get the 
water placement bonus on the temperature scale in   that case is really good to get it could also be 
that you just need to close the game and this is   actually the biggest one especially if you are 
the terraformer if it benefits you in some way   to close the game as soon as possible there will 
actually arise a bunch of scenarios where you just   build a bunch of asteroids especially in the 
last generation maybe the last two generations   and finally it could also be that you're close to 
playing a good card with temperature requirement   but it has to be one of the really good cards 
they basically have to be Farming Trees or Fish   the Air Scrapping standard project where you 
pay 15 to get one Venus this is really hard   to find the redeeming factor for this one this 
one's just straight up bad the only example I   can think of where I would consider getting this 
is because you want to play Venusian Animals or   maybe you can grab the bonus on the Venus scale 
and then we got the aquifier standard project for   18 once again this is also pretty terrible if you 
actually do the math but there are actually some   redeeming factors here the Aquifer actually you 
do want to play this sometimes so first of all   it could be the case that you're close to playing 
a good card with ocean requirements so it could   be kelp farming Penguins it pretty much has to 
be one of these two cards to be worth it to be   honest could also be capital and stuff like this 
could be that you have some water Synergy going   on could also be once again you just desperately 
need to close the game as soon as possible or it   could also be that you can get one of the really 
good placement bonuses the thing is you have two   actions on your turn so if you can place a water 
at your first action and then you play something   amazing next to the water as your second action 
it can actually be quite good then we got the city   and the greenery standard projects and the main 
thing to understand about these is that this is   pretty much a way to get victory points it's not 
good in the early game if you want to build your   engine with cities then you pretty much have to 
have Immigrant City Martian Rails Tharsis maybe   two out of these three cards otherwise the city 
standard project is straight up bad in the early   game it's much better if you have a card with a 
city that's much better and greeneries is pretty   much the same deal it's very bad for building your 
engine especially if we're talking the standard   project build a Greenery for 23 Mega credits but 
in the late game it's very common to actually buy   a bunch of these standard Greenery project for 
23 and the reason is it's a pretty good way to   get victory points in the late game so when should 
you actually buy cities and greeneries well maybe   you need to close the game maybe you want the 
last few available TR before the parameter is   about to close maybe you can get the temperature 
bonus on the oxygen scale or maybe you're close   to playing a good card with oxygen requirement but 
pretty much what this all comes down to is that in   the late game you kind of want to build cities and 
greeneries to actually get VP and finally we got   the colony standard project as I mentioned I think 
this standard product is actually really good it's   definitely the best standard project in the early 
game and in the late game you could argue that   cities and greeneries are better but no matter 
how you slice it you should always look at the   colonies is it actually better to just straight 
up buy a colony rather than playing the card in   my hand sometimes it is and finally tip number 20 
don't keep cards in your opening hand that has a   crazy requirement unless so this one is a little 
bit of a gray area so in my opening hand I would   never keep any of this stuff it's way too late 
game so the only exception would be if I have   the Ecology Experts Prelude then of course trees 
is really good so in the early game pretty much   only keep mid to lategame cards if your economy is 
strong enough to pay the three Mega credit for a   card that you are not soon to use and secondly 
the card must benefit you a lot when you then   finally do play it because what you have to keep 
in mind is the three Mega credits in the earlygame   it could be worth more like 10 mega credits in 
the lategame so you just have to make sure that   the cards you keep in the early game is worth the 
high price of keeping it so you could say a good   tip for beginners is to not keep a card that you 
are not going to use here and now but it doesn't   really reflect the whole truth the truth is a lot 
of good players actually do tend to keep a lot of   mid- to lategame cards pretty early on actually 
so examples of lategame cards you might want   to keep could be the Jovian amplifiers it could 
be some other really good juicy science tags it   could also be some of the plant-production cards 
especially the plant-amplifiers could also be the   green tag amplifiers if I'm going for green tags 
I actually tend to keep these cards pretty early   on as well these can be very powerful so it comes 
down to two things basically first of all is your   engine actually strong enough to keep these late 
game cards in the early game and secondly it's a   lot about Tempo because Terraforming Mars is a 
snowballing game so if you're keeping a lot of   lategame cards in your hand then you're kind 
of delaying the the snowball a little bit so   you could actually make the argument that if 
you're playing all-in on the terraform rating   or all-in on cities then Tempo is actually pretty 
important for use in that case you cannot really   afford to keep so many lategame cards so that's 
really what I mean when I talk about Tempo but   on the other hand if we had a two-player game 
it's a greedy long game maybe 13 Generations   then you definitely want to keep a lot of late 
game cards but that's pretty much it here the   first 10 tips if you want to pause the video here 
are the tips from 11 to 20 and in case you want   to dive just a little bit deeper into educational 
Terraforming Mars videos I have these 20 episodes   planned on my channel most of these should be 
on my channel already THANKS FOR WATCHING!!! :D
