in our previous terraforming Mars playthrough 
we showed you the terraforming Rush strategy   now we're going to look at the second 
major approach to winning which is to   build an engine and draw out the 
game I'll be talking strategy with   a skilled Danish player boneless to look 
at his decisions in this game and to show   you how he got such an incredibly high 
score this is this is legendary tactics all right we're here today with boneless 
for a huge game this one you are showing   us how to maximize your engine so tell me about 
your corporation Choice here your Prelude cards   and your opening card choice yeah um I'm for 
sure we're going for Luna because this is a   two-player game the other Corporation went that 
good and then I had one Prelude with an earth   tag so I'm picking that one and then all I'm 
thinking about now is just get the most card   draw the most engine as humanly possible okay 
I own the contractor I research project so um   right off the bat uh this game is gonna be first 
of all insane and it's also gonna be really fast   paced because I already cropped this down to one 
hour uh I think I kind of had to because otherwise   this video would be far too long so perfect so 
in 60 minutes or less you're gonna get a crazy   amount of content in here yeah so so Point Luna 
let's start with that what what's your uh Focus   there with that's on titanium is it well yeah I 
get 17 in production but mainly the strength of   this Corporation is to get to draw a card every 
time I play an earth tag and this is like one of   the best corporations in two player games it's all 
it's it's always a good cooperation but especially   in two player games you're like inclined to go 
for these long greedy strategies with like a   lot of card grow right so if you're having a lot 
of Car Pro then obviously you'll see more Earth   attack which means that the Luna Corporation is 
just gonna do more for you so it's uh it's a very   good cooperation for for this game and also had 
a starting hand with with some Prelude and some   some cards with like a earth attack so it's a 
it was a no-brainer for sure I'm gonna go for   this you got orbital construction for your Prelude 
right and that that also was to do with titanium   uh I think so I think I had a a one with titanium 
and then I had this Omni contractor which had an   earth tag and three points or something so yeah 
right yeah okay now in terms of the initial card   Choice out of the 10 how many do you usually 
take in a a big game like this where you know   you're going for a long game well pretty much just 
what the biggest engine possible so I take all the   mega credit all the all the steel production or 
titanium production all the discount cards all the   cap draw all of this is stuff I'm looking at and 
of course I'm more inclined to go for Earth tax   because I have this Corporation so I believe I got 
one of the Earth Tech cards that also Bros maker   so there's a lot of good things in the starting 
hand and obviously if if you're gonna get a big   score like this you need to be very lucky and this 
is for sure a very lucky game on my pad well it's   partly luck but it's also partly creating luck 
for yourself too we talked about this with wig   spin where you know you can't get a score like 
this purely based on I mean I would never get   the score no matter how lucky I am because I just 
don't have the skill with the synergies yet yeah I picked up some really nice cards here so that's 
an interesting choice here I'm I'm choosing uh   space station and then I am uh what's my point 
with this because I remember there was a choice   between playing Iron mining Industries or just 
playing the Earth catapult I think I went for   the Earth catapult before yeah I did because now 
I have two discounted old cards um I it was like   a really tough choice because sometimes it's 
actually better to play Iron Man Industries and   then just do that this generation then the next 
Generation you can start playing Earth catapult   and not just get a large discount going but in 
this case I had some other cars I believe I had   like a one more titanium production a lot of a 
few cheap cards so I think I did it like this   these hackers is a questionable card but I 
think it's a two-player game it's a little   bit better and also this is uh still 
early enough that it's it's uh it's okay   you're looking to just uh yeah you're 
looking at the Miranda Resort there   oh yeah yeah for sure uh this is like the best 
topic I could have had it's like perfect nice   so um that's to increase your make oh wow you're 
up to nine uh yeah exactly yeah yeah I think it   gave me six or something crazy because I just had 
so many Earth attacks in my early game so it's a   it's very lucky so so this goes back to the fact 
that I didn't play Iowa mining Industries now now   it ended up being like a lot better because now I 
actually played some Earth tags and that picked up   Miranda's Resort and stuff like this yeah oh wow 
okay so so sometimes the sequence in the order   is is really um governs what you're gonna choose 
next basically it is for sure so right here Rover   construction I kind of want to keep this card but 
the thing is I want to play Iron Man industry so   if you do the math it's it's only add up to 38 
and the iron mining industry is going to cost 37   so I can't actually buy this card I just looked 
at Rover construction yeah okay so so this is   just my generation I just spent my generation uh 
playing these Iron Man Industries and that's fine   wow this is early to be looking at Milestones is 
it not yeah a little bit I don't think I would   be picking them up yet but I can still like plan 
ahead which one am I actually gonna go for because   already now I know that I have a dream game yeah 
so so um I don't wanna I Don't Wanna Give him too   many points I'm feeling all right this I'm I'm 
just gonna crush this guy it's a it's it should   be fine but it's funny you mentioned like order 
of of witch cups to play it and stuff like this   um so so I also have in my hand I believe this 
card um uh what's called Marsh University um and   you might be thinking this is a perfect card to 
play in the early game because it can allowed me   to rotate up but the thing is I haven't started 
playing my my science text yet so I'm actually   waiting to play this card until I plan on playing 
more science tags right okay so yeah you're right   there's a lot of different uh the order of which 
you play cards are really important for sure yeah   your income here is awesome yeah I just I just 
picked up another Earth Tech gold amplifier what   was it cartel or something so yeah yeah it's 
a oh it's a dream game man it really is yeah   yeah I dream of having that kind of production 
one thing I struggle with is I always feel like   I'm I'm short on the the mega credit income 
so am I doing something wrong or uh am I just   not getting the right cards or what what are you 
doing to get up to 11 here I guess is my question   um first of all being lucky uh second of all 
there is a little bit of optimization you can   do you can like not keep as many of the cops that 
are not useful for you but this is like it's it's   hard to you have to look at a game and like have 
to pinpoint what's actually the thing I want to   do with my cars so it's uh I would say without 
hurting your feelings it's probably a little   bit of both but mostly mostly of course the only 
reason I can get this insane Engine 5 titanium and   11 make a credit production at this point that's 
because I'm lucky obviously yeah what would be the   lowest income you would see yourself running 
the game with like do you ever run with like   two or zero or uh sometimes you do it just out 
of like because you you literally have nothing   sometimes you just have a dead hand um but even 
then if you're like playing with colonies you can   like compensate for this but when we are playing 
on the mass app here it's we don't have colonies   right so I think a thing that I would really do 
in every game I would really try to at least get   10 uh money income that could be like Mega credits 
or 10 more terraform rating or something so you at   least have 30 uh gold to start the generation with 
rather than only the 20 you have like to begin   with you you kind of need to get out of this of 
this hole in the early game you really need to to   climb out of there because otherwise it's uh it's 
got a really hard to play the game absolutely it's   cool how you can generate income in different ways 
though in this game I love that yeah for sure yeah   so that that's a lot of different ways to do it 
especially if you have more expansions if you   have colonies there's like even more different 
choices you have to make with with the colonies   so yeah oh there's that imported ghg we talked 
about that in the shorter game coverage yeah   yeah the funny thing is now I'm keeping it for an 
entirely different reason first of all I'm just   keeping four cards here because I had a dream 
game and I have this uh uh what's it called uh   Martian University so just by keeping forecasts 
I have more bad cards in my hand just so I can   rotate those with Marsh University but the reason 
this card you just mentioned is also really good   right now is because it has a Nerf tag and it's 
already really cheap so it's uh it will always it   would also draw me a card with my cooperation 
Point Luna so yeah it's really good now but   for entirely different reasons than the last game 
which is kind of funny now when you buy Milestones   early like that do you sort of tip your hand to 
your opponent of what your strategy is going to   be or would you ever want to hold on and not 
reveal what you're planning I don't think it   says so much about your strategy if they want to 
look at your strategy that just like look at your   your game look at what you're you're doing how 
much plant and heat production do you have would   you just scroll through the Milestone you can 
see what people have anyway right so by actually   buying it don't give that much away I don't think 
but the thing is uh buying them too early could   be a problem in these long greedy two-player 
games but right now we are in generation six   six so uh I think I'm already bought the one 
with 16 cards I think that was also because   now I'm down to 15 cards so I just wanted to buy 
that while I actually had the cars to do so right and the other Milestones I I believe I'm gonna 
check them out sooner or later but the I don't   think there's there's one he's close to yet so 
even though I can actually buy a milestone right   now I would imagine I I probably have the Builder 
close to the builder at this point but even though   I have that I'm not even I'm not even gonna buy 
it until I have to until he's close to buying one   right so yeah that's that's a lot of it's a little 
bit more efficient this way yeah right just to use   your your income like actively on the board as 
opposed to in something that's just sitting there   doing nothing yeah exactly it said Mega credits 
you could spend on engine instead of spending it   on well it basically nothing when it comes to 
engine it will make the no difference if you   if you pick up the Milestone now or in the Next 
Generation so if you can get away with it this is   the way to go does this game ever have a problem 
with people like looking at your engine and saying   oh my gosh this guy is just crushing me and like 
I've got to sit here for another hour playing   against like what's gonna be certain Doom is is 
there a big attrition rate of people dropping out   of games or uh I think would you play on the app 
here for example it's not that bad because it's   uh the game is gonna be over rather quickly but 
in real life if you're uh it happens sometimes   that you're all right this is lost and you just 
have to like wait for a long time before people   actually finish but the it's not interested in 
mention it because in this game in particular   um at this point I already know that I won the 
game this is like there's no question so I'm   I'm thinking uh it's a little bit rude for me to 
just go for 14th generation because the game is   obviously over but what's gonna end up happening 
is my opponent is gonna leave the game so I just   end up playing against an AI so in that case I'm 
like well now now I'm not being rude now now I can   just 14th generation just have some fun so that's 
pretty much what happened in this game so so   if if my opponent didn't leave I wouldn't actually 
have had a game with this big score but this this   one wouldn't have yeah right so yeah that's 
that's that consideration sometimes for sure   yeah the world junior hockey championship is on 
now and yeah they just let the scores run up in   those because oh my God you are so Canadian yeah 
the tiebreaker is yeah I hate when that happens   but uh that's all right so and if people haven't 
seen our other video I'll link to that now and   at the end of the video um the other one is an 
example of the rush play this is an example of   the engine building but you also on your channel 
uh boneless DOTA have all kinds of videos on this   now you've sort of surged with your strategy 
guides so um what what do you cover in those   um everything um it's uh I'm bad at doing 
something halfway so so for this project   I just went all in I just so I have uh I don't 
know maybe 10 or 20 hours of of content just for   a strategy guide it's it's like way too much 
but I just wanted to cover everything so we   have a few games like this one where just went 
for the different strategies there's gonna be   um some of the same replays we're covering 
here and also some some City and some like   a jovian assassin system and also it's gonna 
be it's just gonna be a strategy guide with   uh first of all there's gonna be a lot of tips 
to help win so I'll have two of those videos   and then that's gonna cover all the strategies 
uh and there's gonna be some stuff about the   best synergies in the game and timings and it's 
gonna be a yeah a lot of different things that   for sure oh brilliant okay so yeah 
you're getting all kinds of greenery here   yeah oh and this one is actually kind of 
funny so this Greenery looks really bad   but nobody has a city or rather I don't have a 
city on the map yet so I can't place my Greenery   next to it but yeah this is the reason I wanted 
to play nitrogen Rich asteroid so I needed to put   down this Plantation in order to play this car so 
for sure this is the correct Choice even though it   looks a little bit ugly to just place a Greenery 
that is not next to my city so tell me about when   you would want to use Mega credit versus when you 
want to decrease the cost with your Titanium or   or your other resources um how do you decide 
what the balance is there I think it's pretty   straightforward if you have titanium steel you 
want to use it it could be some cases where you   also have like Advanced LS in your hand in this 
case you have to be a little bit careful because   then you still could a titanium could increase 
in value there's also a few other cars with   consideration where you might actually need the 
the Steeler titanium but but mostly you just want   to use it when you can because these resources can 
only be used for building a SpaceX oh okay gotcha   and what's going what's going through your mind 
here so you're you're in a good position would   you say we're into mid game yeah I mean if we 
look at the other game we just had like a game   was over on generation eight right that's right 
it moves so quickly these two player games are   so fast Yeah well yeah yeah depending on how you 
look at it I would say that five player games is   so fast in terms of generations right because uh 
uh in a two-player game it's it's uh it's gonna   be longer in terms of generations so that's this 
is why I tend to favor this greedy craft strategy   in two player games which this is definitely it 
um I'm keeping all the cards I can get I even   wanted to get even more card draw I'm not getting 
enough for my liking and also I obviously I built   like the biggest engine ever so it's uh this this 
is the defining factor of the car strategy it's   brilliant yeah now I'm finally getting a city on 
the map I even picked up like a stand-up project   and the reason is uh I have a lot of cards in my 
hand but but none of them are like perfect for for   this uh situation right now I I feel like I had 
the the enough money to actually buy this city   and it's also kind of nice because then I could 
place a Greenery next to it and it's a pretty   good placement for a city and a pretty a very good 
placement for the greenery next to it so I can get   like a lot of water adjacency and one Steel so it 
makes a lot of sense to just pick this up now and   now I'm definitely it's uh it's kind of weird 
that nobody's actually claimed the last Milestones   yet but I'm just keeping track of my how far 
my opponent is in that regard yeah okay yeah   so Milestones definitely the next thing I want 
to be doing maybe the first of all just locking   those in yeah and now we hit the mid game um so 
for sure now I'm really beginning to think I'm   making the transition from just building a lot 
of engine now around now on VP so so first I'm   getting decomposers and then I I picked up in my 
hand you could see a lot of green tags so this is   the next point of the menu I just want to play all 
of these green tags this is what I want to do now   how do you make that decision of when to go from 
building your engine to now converting on it   um generally speaking in the early game you build 
engine in the late game you build a VP in this   case it's also more like I don't have that much 
engine lift I have six titanium so that could go   either soleta or it could be the uh 
immigration shuttles so so and other   than that I don't really have any 
engine left so I think it's a good   point it's a good part of the game to 
just really try to go for some some VP   yeah okay and part of your final score must 
depend on when you actually make that pivot   transition yeah yeah for sure because if you 
transition too late then you got this great engine   that didn't actually do anything for you and if 
you transition too early then you lose out on   the maximum um sort of income levels to generate 
PP yeah and that's exactly the the mistake that a   lot of new players are making they just keep 
making engine for the entire game right yeah   guilty right now Advanced allies I just picked 
this up so this is perfect so this is why I   I waited until uh spending some of my titanium 
because I could see that I could draw a few cars   with I don't know how Earth takes or something 
or my actions right um okay and right here it's   perfect because I haven't spent my sixth titanium 
yet so Advanced allies and then I can play one of   my expensive titanium cards that's perfect oh nice 
so I hate to do this to you but uh I'm more of a   wingspan my wingspan player myself and I think for 
me it never felt really overwhelming even though   there's tons and tons of birds in that whereas 
with terraforming Mars I sometimes feel like   this game is just there's so much going on but 
of the two which which game do you prefer and why   oh it's a really hard question I think both of 
them are really great excellent games and both of   them are engine building the differences that in 
terraform us you can have a little more fun with   your engine you can build a nice engine wingspan 
but then the game is Just immediately over right   um so slight favorites to terraform your mouse 
but you know me I've played a lot of games in   both so obviously I love both games so it's good 
yeah yeah this one just seems like I wouldn't   pull terraforming Mars out at a family gathering 
but I would pull wing span out because it might   be just the theme but uh well also the complexity 
uh when everything is said and done wingspan is a   lot easier to to change it's more like a Gateway 
game terraforming Mouse it's a lot of rules and   also the biggest thing is like for new players 
this takes like three or four hours maybe to to   play a game especially if you have to explain the 
rules first so yeah and the strategy is a lot more   complex than this because there's a lot more sort 
of interlinking approaches that you can there's   more options I would say whereas with wingspan 
it's a little bit more linear yeah I would I would   say that the yeah for sure in in wingspan I get 
like oh yeah Central Pool and wingspans I could   like lose a game to anyone if if they maybe not 
his first game but but if he or she like had maybe   a few games and they were just very lucky and I 
was very unlucky in wingspan that's like little   you can do right yes but in terraforming mass is 
basically impossible to to lose to someone who's   new to the game if you're very experienced at the 
game because there's so many different paths to   victories and like you said the complexity is just 
so high yeah yeah and I think that's what makes   some of those family-friendly or Gateway games 
so popular is that it's it's not a predetermined   winner based on skill or experience yeah that's a 
good thing so some people like one of my friends   he doesn't like lock in board games and I try 
to explain him then you should play chess or   something it's a rock is part of the game and it's 
what makes it fun in a lot of cases so right you   have to overcome the uh the impediments that are 
placed in front of you yeah yeah but to get back   to the game here um I believe I end up making a 
lot of points on green tax energy so so this is   definitely what I've been starting to build up 
right now yeah and so so I think decomposers and   a little bit later I also get the ecological Zone 
and maybe also violent enhances I haven't really   been paying attention but some of these cards 
are actually you shouldn't underestimate how many   points these cards can actually give you it's it's 
you'll see at the end of this game it is quite   insane how many points you can get on these cards 
so you probably don't remember the exact numbers   but where do you think the majority of your points 
are coming from in this game then just on the   greenery Cuts cuts for sure I mean if you also 
like I think it's gonna be like maybe 54 points   on top of cards just from Green text and and other 
things I put on top of my cards and then the card   itself is going to be another 100 points right I 
think okay maybe 170 points it's just from cards so that's for sure where the majority of no 
actually I think I said this wrong because I think   the way they calculated is they they um I think 
it's only going to be 110 points on cards actually   because I think the 54 points that I'm talking 
about those are part of the the the the card   um like like here you can see I have 15 
victory points on cards I think this is   things on top of my cars also included so 
I think I said it wrong I accepted it a   little bit I think I just have 110 points 
on cards when everything is hidden up well   they'll have to watch through to the end 
to find out yeah yeah we'll see for sure so this is the AI hard has jumped in now for 
the uh for Mississippi I I don't I don't I   don't blame uh her uh I think at this point it's 
uh yeah that's not surprising it's a it's a it's   a losing game but like I said uh if if the person 
had actually stayed uh I probably just would end   it like maybe in 11 or 12. yeah okay yeah but but 
because the person left and it's only in hard AI   now I'm definitely just gonna just put the boots 
to them yeah I wanna I'm a little bit greedy right   now I'm like all right this game is actually 
insane I could get one of the really big scores   so uh well that's why I try for that that's yeah 
some of the point of playing it's really just   to really maximize and yeah so what what does 
Robinson Industries do what uh strategy is that   Corporation for the hard AI do you remember that 
one uh I believe Robinson Industries that's the   one where you can pay four Mega credit to actually 
increase your lowest income okay so it's a pretty   I never get excited when I see 
this Corporation but it can be okay   um but it's kind of awkward because it requires 
you to to have a little bit of everything yeah um Olympus conference this is a card I 
definitely would have wanted a lot earlier   and now you will see this is why it makes a lot 
of sense for me to keep some cards in my hand like   um um I had this this cheap science 
card in my hand what's it called um yeah but but one of the cheap science texts 
that does nothing for me except give me VP   usually I want to play those later because 
it just increases in value now it's also   worth like half a cup because I just picked up 
Olympus conference right so this goes back to   the stuff we talked about earlier like card 
sequencing is is really important for sure so now the the next bonus that I'm looking 
at is the bonus to get on the oxygen scale   okay right this is why I'm not using my plan 
chip and here is a really interesting choice   because I just picked up a herbivores and 
I think this yeah I think in the start of   the Next Generation I think I'm gonna 
end up actually making a few greeneries   without playing herbivores so normally you 
wouldn't do this but that's a reason for   this but that's for Next Generation in this 
generation I'm just uh looking at this bonus   and I'm just trying to to still get my green text 
energy up and running play my cards so right now   I'm drawing one more card to see what I get and I 
think right now I have eight plants and I believe   I'm not sure but maybe I have protected 
habitat at this point um so I might even   be considering to just not build a Greenery 
right now because I want to [Music] um I want to actually get the bonus in the Next 
Generation if I can right okay yeah I think uh   I think this is also the game where I I have a lot 
of like it's a microbes energy but unfortunately   because I was a little bit stressed for time or 
maybe I I just made a mistake uh I I put a lot   of these three microbes I put it on decomposers 
but I also played ants and ants it's actually   better because ants gives a point for two microbes 
and decomposers gives a point per three microbes   I think I'm cheating myself a little bit out of 
some points by actually putting it on decomposers   rather that ends so not good I've got one question 
about oceans for you um where do you tend to play   some do you play some like to block people or um 
what what's the The Guiding strategy on placing   oceans uh there's a little bit of consideration 
you can't really block anyone but you can like   make sure they don't get so many good adjacency 
bonus tiles like if you pace place oceans close   to the cities maybe you'll you'll give them a 
nice place to play that greeneries but mostly   oceans come back comes down to what do you need 
yourself do you need the usually you want to play   it next to other oceans but the especially in the 
early game there's like on this map there's like   a juicy place where you can get two cards so you 
could get two titanium or the one card is also   good especially if these long games the cards and 
the titanium and stuff like this is really good   if I'm going all in for the terraforming 
strategy I might place it in the river in the   middle because there's a lot more plants available 
there um yeah something like this is what I would   consider but I would always favor this place where 
you can get two cards I think this is really good   okay so uh what are you looking at here with the 
Ganymede colony yeah normally I would play this   in the last generation but the this is simply 
because there must be a reason I'm playing it   now is it just because of satellites I think it is 
I think it's because I have so much titanium so I   could just get one more make a credit production 
because of satellites which is funny yeah that's   what I'm doing so it's a it doesn't happen 
very often normally you would play this in the   last generation but in this particular case 
because I have so much titanium and because   I have satellites it's okay to play it now maybe 
there's a few other effects I haven't been keeping   track so maybe you can benefit me a little bit 
in another way but it's questionable to play   this right now for sure okay well if any people 
see any any other questions or things that you   think you've done wrong or things you've you've 
done well if they want to add their thoughts in   the comments that would be great yeah sure I would 
really welcome that um I know that I play I I did   a few mistakes that I'm aware of but I probably 
also did a few mistakes I'm I'm not aware of so   if you see anything feel free to to write it and 
I'll make sure to to visit your channel once in a   while and and answer those questions so yeah for 
sure that's great now are you purposely trying   to slow the game here with the oxygen levels or 
maybe I mean oceans are getting close temperatures   getting close do you want to lengthen this out 
as much as you can here yeah for sure um I think   definitely that's what I'm gonna do I think I'm 
still gonna be greedy and go for this bonus but   the right here I'm getting colonizer training camp 
and I'm getting some some more plant production   once again I'm just keeping it all because I want 
some carbs to cycle with with my mush University   it's so funny when it happens right you just keep 
everything because you're having a God game and   you just want to to cycle just buying everything 
you can you can get your hands on eh 15 yards for   sure but right now uh it's very tempting for me to 
play exactly adaptive technology because with this   I can actually play this uh colonizer training 
camp because otherwise the requirement has been   maxed normally you can only play this if there's 
like five oxygen but because of this car just   Place adaptive technology now I can actually play 
it and still it's a little bit greedy to do this   rather than just taking the bonus so so that's a 
lot of things here so right now if you just get   so many choices open to you with so many cards 
with such an incredible income look at that 46.   yeah right now I'm just remembering her because 
in my mind herbivores is eight oxygen but I just   played this card adaptive technology so this means 
that I I kind of place one Greenery now without   having placed other people so now I kinda have to 
go for the other one because I'm not gonna leave   the bonus one step away from him right okay but it 
actually ends up being okay because for example I   also have wild enhancers I have ecological zone 
so it's it's not that bad actually and also what   ends up happening what you asked me before if I'm 
gonna intentionally prolong the game that's what   I'm gonna do now right here is where I'm deciding 
okay I'm actually gonna wait a long time before I   play herbivores because what I'm gonna do I have 
protected habitat so I'm just gonna actually just   Stack Up on plants and just not terraform the the 
oxygen so if you want to close the game he would   have to do all the hard work I'm not gonna help 
him so this is one of the things you can really   do to actually just prolong the game artificially 
Yeah just they can just watch themselves lose   slowly yeah and normally you lose a little bit 
of efficiency because you lose a little bit of   like money income because you don't get the TR 
like right sooner but in this case my engine is   huge so I don't care about that know I just care 
about the game dragging out so I can so I can go   to 14 Generations that's probably what I'm hoping 
for right now would you tend to want say two of   the three variables to be closed so that you can 
close the game when you want or do you want to   actually hold back on all three of the end game I 
think it's uh around the mid game you can always   spot the last parameters that's close it could be 
kind of close between two but in this case it's   definitely going to be oxygen or maybe even water 
but I mean it's definitely going to be oxygen   that's the hardest one to close so with this in 
mind I don't really care about water or heat I can   I might even terraform that myself uh I don't I 
don't mind that but right now I just want to hold   back my plan so I'm not gonna terraform the oxygen 
too much yeah that's okay yellow two parameters I   don't care about that much and there's no limit 
on how many cards he can have in hand in this   game is there no no no not at all no so what's 
your record I think if you go for this greedy   card strategy and and just play the long games 
and usually only two player games I think it's   I don't know usually usually if you have around 20 
cards you're you're greedy enough but I've had a   few games but just so much card towards like even 
been 30 cards in my hand or something oh wow yeah   yeah it can it can go quite crazy so right here I 
picked up uh this is just a nice place for a city   so I don't think they make a creative production 
from immigrant City is such a big deal at this   point but right now I just wanted to place it 
because it's a very nice place for a city oh   it's beautiful could come into play a little 
bit I could get some from this card because uh   uh yeah I know that am I having the guard game 
so sooner or later that's probably probably me   is gonna build a lot of cities on the map as well 
right yeah so uh I just picked up the other Big   Green Tech amplifier which is ecological Zone 
which allows me every time I play a plant tag I   um I can get like half a point I believe I could 
get an animal worth half a point so this is   one of the other really big ones I also got well 
enhancers and decomposers so the green tax energy   is definitely up and running so now you'll see all 
the plant tags that I've been I have played some   right because I uh you can't go all in on this you 
also have to play the cards when it makes sense   to you right but for sure I've been keeping some 
of these cards just so I know that all right I'm   gonna play ecological Zone and then I can play 
all of these plant tech cards in my hand yeah   there's so much planning involved in 
this and there's just so many options   yeah for sure so uh I think this is also the 
game where I get the most amount of of VP on on   this uh uh Predator it's gonna be I don't know 
I can't remember 11 or something it's gonna be   a lot of points on Predator but that's because 
it's very good in this game especially for the   long rated games to have one animal where 
the animals are worth one Victory Point per   animal because there's a lot of other cards 
in this game that can actually give animal to   another car so like large Convoy or imported 
nitrogen that I have here see your opponent   has the pets card which in our strategy guide 
you mentioned is one that you like yeah for   sure pets especially if you or someone else is 
going for City Pets is of course very very good   yeah but but that one is pretty tied to the city 
strategy right it's uh right yeah normally it's   cheap enough that you would like play it in most 
games anyway especially if you can also benefit   from the earth tag but the but usually it's even 
better if someone is going for cities obviously   because then it's gonna it can give you like a lot 
of points I've seen games where it gave me like   10 points or something in peps and it's it's a lot 
yeah sure yeah especially in those smaller scoring   games right relative to the the total score 
it can be a lot you're just buying everything   yeah I'm actually is this uh I think I have 
11 cards in my hand and I think I think I   only bought three this time so I think I'm finally 
to the point where I'm I'm not uh I still I have   so many bad cards on my hand already that it's 
okay so I I at this point I only buy three yeah   because you know that I'm a crazy greedy 
person when I pick up tall station and   robotic Workforce these cards are still we're 
generation 12 and I'm still thinking about   engine yeah because it's so efficient for 
me to do rubber I'm kind of feeling bad for   this AI or Robertson Industries is his income 
everything it just pales in comparison to yours   yeah but the funny thing is he's still gonna he's 
still gonna take minor from me because if you've   noticed I haven't actually started any awards 
that's also me I was aware of him I didn't forget   it I was kind of it was completely intentional 
I just I just automatically assumed that I would   win every single award in this game because I'm 
having such an insane game so it was purely greed   but as it turns out it's actually gonna overtake 
me in Miner which I did not see coming so uh I   was very salty about that one I remember well 
if artificial intelligence had emotions when   he joined this game in the position he was 
in he was probably just devastated yeah yeah it was not ready but a good thing he did because 
otherwise I wouldn't have dragged it out like this   yeah because what you're seeing right now this is 
like only the crop down version of this game which   is still like one hour and you as you can see like 
all the actions is going really quickly yes it is   how long was the original yeah I think maybe two 
hours or something I think I had wow I had one   hour and my opponent had one hour so maybe almost 
two hours or something so this is what happens   when you go complete god mode like normally 
a cure for 30 minute games or 45 minute games   depending on how many players are in the game yep 
but sometimes when you just want to go go greedy   and join a two-player game and just then one hour 
is sometimes actually necessary because even with   I skip all the animation stuff like that you can 
you can do that in the options but even this is   not enough it's still gonna be hard to actually 
finish a game in in 45 minutes sometimes yeah   oh yeah this is lightning quick though I 
mean yeah it is it's a if you want you can   check out the game on my channel I also 
do this and I I feel a bit guilty because   on my channel I was a little bit better at 
actually explaining all the strategy and the   available plays going on but right yeah right 
now when I'm talking to you we're just having   a good time I I can't keep up with all of this 
that's what I'm trying to say no kidding yeah   I'm completely distracting you my apologies but 
that's fun no I think it's impossible even even   the one on my channel it's impossible to actually 
talk about all the stuff going on because it's   yeah it's just going so far fast paced yeah it 
really is okay so card resources what are we up   to here you're uh you just slapped a penalty on 
there on him yeah that's what was that something   with the animals there yeah I probably use my 
Predator right oh yes okay I think I think I I   steal his fish yeah I think he has both fish 
and and I don't know some other cars but I   think I steal fish because it makes sense in 
my head that the Predator actually eats fish   okay it's a little brutal brutal if he's like 
eating uh I don't know one of the other ones   like for example if you if you take if you have 
a game in real life uh you have also have this   uh card from the Venus expansion called venusian 
animals and it's uh it's very I have a hard time   figuring out how it's possible for the Predator 
to actually put on his spacesuit go to Venus eat   a venusian animal go back to Mars be a bear but 
the eating a fish that makes a lot of sense to me   yeah thematically it's neat I find the game grows 
on you where there's all these different elements   like at first it just feels like you're playing 
a board game and there's a million cards but when   you start to see the synergies of the different 
um themes in the game that I I really I'm just   starting to grow on me yeah yeah for sure it's uh 
it's a very well put together game for sure well   there's a reason it's it's top 10 on Board 
Game Geek for who knows how many years well   probably since 2016. still going strong yeah it's 
amazing actually yeah but the I don't think it can   it can probably not keep keep its position up 
there I think that's a lot of sooner or later   it's gonna it's gonna be a little bit dated but 
it's uh it's very it's very nice that it's still   going this strong there's still so many players 
playing it so it's a yeah it's already a classic   have you played brass Birmingham no no not yet 
one of my friends wanted me to play it but I   haven't gotten around to it yet yeah I think 
you'll enjoy that one it's uh it's another one   in the vein of wingspan I heard it's also easy 
building yeah yeah definitely maybe not quite   as in-depth as this one but uh still pretty 
solid yeah I just played Doon Imperium that's   another one of the new games that's that's well 
it's like a year old by now I think but I just   played it I just I just played it for the first 
time and I was very hyped it's a it's a fun piece   oh that's cool the interforming Mars would 
be in your top three games of all time yeah   for sure I mean it can right now I'm maybe 
a little more interested in playing Doom   Imperium but like when everything is said and 
done like of course it's I've played so many   hours in terraforming master so it's it must be my 
favorite game of all time I think that's awesome   okay we better get back to the game now so 
yeah I was about to say so I am still like   robotic Workforce it's a really good combo to use 
this with the medical lab that I already played   earlier because I can I can copy a building 
space a little building like Square on the   on one of the cards so medical lab is SD card 
to actually combo this card with when you're   only playing vanilla because you don't have 
access to geropolis which is another good one   um so and I think it still makes sense just 
because uh I'm gonna get so much out of it   and it also has a science tag so I have so much 
science Synergy from like Olympus conference and   Mars University that still makes a lot of sense 
for me to play this card and then tell stage and   I also picked up this it's like at this point I'm 
kind of feeling okay maybe it's gonna be over in   generation 13. so I'm playing six foot tall 
station but I'm probably still gonna give me   more than six so in this regard it could still be 
worth it um but it's uh it's very greedy to keep   going for engine but like you can see they're 
so cheap and they give me other things like   like the Science Tech and robotic Workforce 
so it still makes sense to me that's right   how many actions is your opponent getting here 
compared to how many you're getting would you say   uh I don't have the numbers but for sure I have 
all the advantage because I have like you can   see my action on my cards it was like an entire 
screen so I had maybe 10 20 different actions I   can actually do so no matter what's happening he's 
gonna pass the generation before me so this means   that it's uh it's entirely within my hands how 
I'm gonna actually end this generation because I'm   not even slow playing at this point this is just 
how far ahead I am I have so many actions so sort   of what you dream of when you first learn this 
game is just having every choice in the universe   yeah for sure and it's like I'm going for the 
car strategy so normally you wouldn't also   well you could but normally it's you wouldn't 
also like fill up the map with like cities and   greeneries but right when you're having like 
I'm just doing everything because I can yeah   to generate a big score like this uh well it's I 
haven't hit the 300 on the app but I've hit 300   in real life and on the app I don't know I've 
had a couple of games of maybe three games and   106 no 260 plus and every time you hit you get 
a big score like this you just have to go for   everything because you really have to milk 
the game from from for all the points so a   big component of this is screen text energy 
that's like a a big thing and obviously you   can only do this if your engine in the other 
game is amazing if you have a ton of card draw   so oh wow how do you how do your friends 
not rage quit on you when you get over 300   yeah I don't know that's a good question it 
doesn't happen that often in in uh uh normally   when I play with my friends just we are like four 
you know so so normally these two player games   I had one friend doing lockdown I played a lot of 
tour play games with him and we had just had a lot   of fun and played like I don't know 20 or 30 just 
when the corona started so it always came to me my   place and we played a lot of two men instead of 
my mask oh no but that's that's pretty much the   only uh the only time I actually played a lot of 
two-player games in real life normally to play a   game to something I do in on the mass app I think 
in real life it's more common that when we meet   up we are like four or something yeah okay oh you 
must have a good friend group then yeah for sure a   few um so so normally um like when it's a small 
player game you're of course not gonna get big   scores like this like we talked about because then 
there's gonna be fewer Generations there's gonna   be more people actually sharing the terraform 
rating that's gonna be so so the scores like this   is impossible in four player games right yeah 
of course yeah that was what surprised me most   actually but our Chad and the strategy guide was 
just about every question you seem to come back to   the player count is absolutely vital for almost 
every decision in the game so that was that was   surprising I might exaggerate a little bit like 
you can still play the card strategy in a five   player game if like you have the perfect setup 
for it like so it's not like don't don't take it   like you can only play like this no you just you 
mostly you play your cards but you really have   to have this in the back of your head like some 
strategies are really suited for for shorter or   or fewer player numbers and some strategies are 
really suited for for larger player numbers for   instance the the terraforming strategy where I 
just go all Inland terraforming you can do like   a middle middle road kind of thing in two player 
games but but in in like if you're gonna all in on   terraforming and you are doing nothing else then 
you should not play two player because it simply   doesn't work you can't close the game that fast 
so the other guy is gonna have enough time either   way with his greedy engine and it's not gonna take 
so long to for him to actually beat you yeah so uh   yeah player number is definitely very important 
now why did you play your city right beside the   other City there um was that was that the best 
place you could find or um are you talking about   on the bottom of the screen yeah that's right 
yeah I don't think that's the city I played it   next to that would have been illegal unless I had 
some I think it's a special time but uh it's it's   really hard to see in the on this it's one of the 
one of the few critiques I have with it but um um   I think this just made a lot of sense I think my 
point right now is I want to first of all I want   to see if he actually closes the game here at 13 
if he does not then I'm Gonna Make It Go to 14. um   that that's the number one priority and secondly 
if it goes to 14 then then I definitely want all   of the good City spots the city spots is uh like 
you can see I don't have that many cars anymore   right so if I do get another generation I'm I 
really want to spend all of my plans and all of my   mega credits but actually cities all over the map 
because this is the way I can get points right now   and this Lane claim up here it's actually kind 
of cool because normally you play a land claim so   actually annoy the other guy but this Lane claim 
makes it like not a hundred percent but almost   100 sure that this city I I will get this city 
like there's no questions asked because normally   if you play a game claim the other guy can just 
put something right next to your lane claim but   in this case it would be illegal because the way 
I place my Series so this Lane claim is actually   kind of clever I think and like you probably saw 
I finally played my um what's it called the Bambi   yeah oh right yes the urban RCs and so this is a 
live like look how many I even spent some plans   but I'm still 62 plants left so now I'm like 
yeah I'm I I just want cities I just wanna   finally spend all of my plans and uh as soon as he 
passes I'm just gonna terraform everything until   there's like one step left because then I get the 
maximum out of the last available Tia as well yeah   yeah it's kind of it's kind of a thick move to be 
honest but once again uh the guy left so it's it's   only hard AI so I don't feel bad about it yeah 
exactly just put it to them [Music] yeah so um yeah I'm still just like using my actions once 
again it's not even slow playing because it's I   just have to go through all of my action I'm 
not even like taking only one action on my   turn and then passing right it would be totally 
viable if I did but in this case I have so many   actions I don't even have to do that I'm just 
going through the motions waiting for him to   pass and then as soon as he passes I'm gonna like 
oh wow yeah terraform everything except for one   step and finally spent my 63 playing totally here 
seems like ants are doing all right for you there   yeah for sure it's a good card just because 
um so it's it's not often you actually get to   steal from another especially in two player 
game it's a little bit unlikely that he has   um something to steal yeah but just the fact 
that it's a microcut that can wear microbes   are worth one Victor Point per two microbe 
I believe in vanilla and this is vanilla and in this meter there's like a novenusian insects 
or another card that can actually do this so   it's only ants where the insects are actually 
worth this much so this is why it's a it's a   good card especially when I have so many cards 
that actually this is it just takes forever to   get through all of your actions yeah it really 
does and this is like if you look at the first   like you barely have time to actually introduce 
and and like establish cast oh we actually had   generation three or something and uh and now now 
it's the last generation maybe the next one as   well is yeah so many actions so this is why it 
ends up saying one hour even though we cropped   it down and like rushed through it and stuff 
like this yeah yeah it's fun to see though it's   sexy enjoy to watch it yeah it's uh for sure it's 
it's uh so now the the water has been closed I   believe I actually helped uh that's right I can 
see that he's been closing um I think he's passed   maybe that's what I'm looking at but if he's not 
passed yet then I believe I I got a little bit in   on the water at the end uh because it's it's gonna 
be oxygen that's the last one to to close the game   um and finally I'm I'm about to to spend my 
plans I think this is uh he just plays the   city like in the middle of my two cities he 
had a cop that could do that what's it called   immigrant something I don't know yeah oh actually 
was lava tube settlement so it has to be placed   on a volcano that's what happened okay um 
yeah but the but by him doing that it's of   course very annoying for me but then I had 
this other card commercial district and now   I can place this next to the three cities 
and also I'll get one more City on my land   claim so it ends up being okay because now my 
commercial district is gonna it's gonna be great this is fun yeah you've just got so 
many plants there yeah it's uh and   I still haven't played insect yet it's 
uh it's quite it's a lot maybe it's the   most plants I've ever had on the game it's a 
very insane I'd say yeah that's awesome also   I have this card that gives me like one plant 
per City so yeah this is gonna get crazy man so uh maybe it passed now yeah I I checked the 
lock and I okay he finally passed so now here we   go let's go now we're finally gonna I'm only gonna 
get two plants now because once again I want to   look closer to 14. so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna 
spend my 47 plans until the next Generation yeah but I think uh I don't know why I get 
energy production there must be a reason   um I wonder but the uh for sure it's 
insects I should be looking at right now   and also this one normally you play this 
in the last generation but right now I   already have all of the green tags in look at 
this green text energy I get from this card   and also it's because it's one more clam 
tag for the m6 and I didn't have any   impactful beta cards to play so right now I 
think I'm at the point to just sell three cards   so probably yeah I have three bad cards are you 
imagine I would still underwrap detonation Great   Escape and Consortium and and one more so I can 
just play insects I think that's what I'm gonna do yeah and then biomass combusters it gives me minus   victory points so it makes no 
sense to play at this point yep that is a lot of plans for sure in the 
awards there's only one award so far yeah   this yeah this is this is actually the computer 
style of this one this is like the miner so I I   I'm really salty I had to go to that one because 
I thought I would just automatically get all three   gotta let him have a bone at least at least one 
minor success yeah and the thing that really   hurts is that I I just did it because I'm greedy 
but what's gonna end up happening is that the   I'm gonna have a lot of Mega current left over 
when this game is done so the fact that it   didn't just it take three Milestones is like ah 
it hurts so much because it's not even it's not   even all right I didn't get the award but then 
I saved some money no it didn't matter because and because I'm gonna end up having so much gold 
left over oh it's insane you were just at 139 Mega   credits yeah yeah that's awesome and right now 
it's uh um what I really should be doing is just   fill up the map as soon as I can like get the last 
maybe you won't see there for one two but yeah   just get the green race as soon as yeah I'm 
getting one more City it makes sense uh this   this one I'm not why would I place on top of 
my Lane claim that one is secured so that was a   mistake I think that's a little bit of uh things 
I should do before and and after like right now   I'm getting the awards but I think basically 
I just don't want to repeat the mistakes from   earlier by not by not taking the world but really 
what I should be doing is fill up the map um but it doesn't matter that much at this point 
because he will have he will get like a fuse maybe   one city and a few greeneries and there's little 
I can do to stop him he will do that so it doesn't   matter that much but just from a technical point 
of view I should really be filling up the map   you have 14 actions down there available yeah that's once again like in the 
other Generations I started with my   action because I wanted to to see what 
my opponent is doing is he gonna close   the game but in this last generation because 
I'm literally running out of ways I can get   VP so this is why it's in impeccable it's 
really important that I just get as many   greeneries down on the map as soon as possible 
because if he actually gets greeneries down   like and I still have greeneries left in 
my head it would be annoying it would be   annoying points out the window so I just 
have to fill up the map as soon as possible   hmm because I'm I'm still gonna have leftover 
Mega credits when when the game is done so I think I technically I misplayed a little bit 
at the start of this generation I did a lot of   stuff that I didn't really have to do technically 
what I should have done is just fill up the map   yeah right yeah do you think you would have 
scored that many more points doing that though   no it's it's not the biggest deal I think when 
when everything is said it's done he's probably   just gonna get like a few greeneries a few cities 
and maybe he's gonna run out of gold way before   this comes into play but technically I should 
have filled up the map sooner rather than later   so I I I might have been missing like 
a little bit but it's hard to say I   would have to check his profile to or 
his game to actually see how much uh   Mega credits he has how many 
cities he can make right yeah but it ends up being hmm I got eight eight plants 
left in the spot for one more Greenery so it ends   up like all of the plants I've been saving up 
and it just works out completely it's a little   bit funny yeah it's it's really fun to watch 
you actually just seen so many go down yeah um so hopefully I start putting this on ends 
yeah nice that's probably the biggest mistake   I did is that I I couldn't decomposer so long 
time instead of ants right yeah and the other   big mistake was not starting all of the awards 
that's like five points out the window right there other than that I'm pretty happy with how 
I played it's only it's only minor things I   did wrong I think really is it's really hard 
to improve on this yeah but it's a uh I'm uh   once again I'm the bad kind of a perfectionist so 
when I make small misplaces like this it really   annoys me you know what I mean that's right we'll 
just gloss over it let's just focus on the good   so right now it's pretty straightforward I I 
did I filled up the map that was I I started   the last award so there's there's no rush 
anymore and I was just spend use all of my   actions and hopefully the cards I have in my 
hand will draw some even more impactful cards   because I still have 79 Mega credits so yeah 
you're just trying to find ways to blow your   millionaire status here yeah so how many I 
think yeah I've fallen 14 Predators that's   probably also the the biggest amount I've ever 
had on Predators that's a lot that's awesome are there a lot of interactions do you find 
Direct interactions between players in these   engine building games or does it tend to be 
more people playing their own boards I think   people are like some people think that there's 
a lot of some people think this is a solitaire   game where it's only it's only like you just 
play your thing multiplayer is so low yeah   and and to a point they're correct because 
you cannot hit your opponents that much   but that's also one other thing I like about this 
game you cannot just like destroy a player if   he said right yeah so I think the amount of 
clearance action is actually pretty good in   this game I think I like it a lot the way it is 
um but the there's actually a lot of things you   can do like for example the biggest thing that 
separates um a mediocre player from a new player   is is probably just figuring out who got the 
bigger engine and is it in my best interest to   actually drag out the game or is it in my best 
interest to close the game that's really nice   um because yeah that's the biggest way you can 
hurt degree opponent is just to close the game   basically just finish it up yep yeah other 
than that yeah you can burn a little bit of   plans and you can take away like there's some 
really damaging cards if you like take away one   titanium production or play hackers on the first 
generation that could actually mess up a player   so much but but other than that it's not that 
much it's not that impactfully what you can do   and so I think it's a I like I like the game 
the way it is I think it's a very good balance   and of course like contesting Milestones like 
it's also a big thing consisting bonuses like   if you're if you're playing against 
Bad opponents like one of the reasons   uh this was also a very very good 
game for me is of course that um I don't know how good the pla I'm imagining the 
player wasn't like that good the one I played   against but it's really hard to say because I 
have a God game so maybe you know maybe maybe   the guy could just skate up gave up or something 
you can't really judge like this but but when I'm   playing against an AI he's probably not gonna make 
optimal plays so that's right yeah you seem to be   just crashing them on every count except that 
one except that that minor thing that one yeah   one award it's all right so yeah I'm gonna pass 
the game with 33 Mega credits so it it doesn't   happen very often but we are not playing with 
Venus so I can't I cannot even just buy two Venus   or something it's a it's weird it's rare that you 
run out of options to dominate yeah it is it is   okay so tell me about the end game scoring here 
well let's see how much I get on points I think   maybe 110 or something and 50 of those is like 
on top of cards so that's the green tax energy   is how I'm getting like the most points yeah 150 
victory points on cars and that's that's basically   because like at least half of that is green tax 
energy and stuff I just put on top of my cards   so that's a big one and then because I'm having 
a God game then obviously cities in greeneries is   also really good yeah me too yeah terraforming 
rating was pretty solid I mean I think in our   last game your entire score was 29 or 79 and 
yeah yeah exactly it's very hard to compare but   this is what I mean that it's entirely different 
manner if you play two player and especially if it   goes leads like this it's a greedy 14 generation 
game or if it's a 9th generation game it's like   totally different so this is why it's so hard to 
actually compare scores and terraformers you have   to take into account number of players you have 
to take into account so many different things   how many expansions are you playing with that's 
your video to get high scores if you also have   colonies and and some of the other expansions so 
it's there's so many things you have to take into   account so this is why in wingspan is always 
like all right this score is good because the   meta is always the same it's always this amount 
of terms it's always well it can vary a little   bit if you're if you're like against one or two 
or three opponents on wingspan but basically you   always have the option of creating the same level 
of score in terms of mass is entirely different   because it just comes down to how many players how 
many generations do we have so many things yeah   well it was a pleasure watching you dominate I
