today I'm here with boneless and he's 
teaching me a brand new terraforming   Mars player how to completely dominate at 
this game he's put together an over 100   slide comprehensive approach to really doing 
well at this game this is legendary tactics alright boneless so you I can see have poured a 
ton of time into this so tell me about what what   we're looking at today yeah today we're going to 
look at like a I just came up with like a literal   recipe for success I think it was really useful 
to just look at what you need in the different   part of the game what you should focus on so uh 
today's this is just gonna be like a light we're   just gonna touch on a lot of different things and 
then in the bottom of the screen there will be a   little a little text when it says where you can 
go to see more perfect and you've got a link to   your channel where you you go into real detail 
on each of these so um do check out boneless   dota's Channel if you'd like to find out more 
about this but today we're like we're doing a   wider snapshot so what I really like about how 
you've structured this is that you've got your   opening hand which is the early game you've 
got your early to mid game section and you've   got your mid to late game section and I think 
it's really important that the strategy changes   over that time period so are you ready to begin 
sure okay so let's start with the opening hand   yeah basically the first thing this is like a 
list of priority so the first thing I'm looking   for is just money income and capital so before 
I look at any of the other stuff I just want to   see how can I get the biggest engine like here 
and now in my opening hand and can I get some   card draw to Cobble with this and then also 
once we have that we can begin uh looking at   some of the other things so for example if you 
go to yeah your default strategy is the engine   strategy then just build out as much and as fast 
as the opening a hand it doesn't have to be even   if you're going for the terror for me strategy 
you still want to look at do I have any make a   Critic production do I have any character I 
mean capital is situational if you're going   like for the fast game but if it could still we 
are talking about the opening handset nevertheless   it's still like good to notice if you have one 
or some of the stuff that's right perfect okay Yeah so basically in the beginning you will 
need the money income so on the on the top   of the screen here we have all the stuff that's 
like good for building your engine and it's like   like you're talking about I'm mostly enjoying 
greedy games so definitely all of this stuff   like titanium production steel production make 
a creative production all of this stuff that   really helps you build card helps you buy cars 
during the game on the bottom of the screen   uh it says if it's in your interest to close 
the game you can also build your engine with   heat and TR but like I said even if if you 
even if you're building your engine this way   you still need a little bit of money income 
to actually glue it together if that makes   sense you can't just absolutely expect to win 
the game you need a little bit of income yeah   regardless of your strategy money's got to 
be there tell me which uh expansions are we   talking about here is this just the base 
game or are we also referring to colonies   I think all of these tips here uh they're good 
no matter how many expansions you play with but   basically for the most part we are also talking 
about pre-alert we're also talking about colonies   so all expansions except for turmoil I would 
say but these are more like General ideas of   things you should look for so even if you don't 
have all the expansions this will still be useful   excellent thank you okay so we're moving into 
card draw now and there are three cards that   you're suggesting we always keep almost yes um 
The Only Exception would be actually we'll gotta   get to the exceptions in just a second but yeah 
before we get to that these three are just Stellar   card Pro cards I think and the the reason these 
are so good is because these are like effects so   when something happens you get a card and these 
are just a little bit Superior compared to just a   flat flat cap that just gives you a card once per 
generation like as an action card okay so you see   these take them that's Mars University Olympus 
conference and spin-off department now there   are some other cards that you should keep most 
of the time yeah I mean Capital cars in general   um if you're going for the greedy Club strategy or 
just if you're going for the long game really then   you definitely take all the card Pro you can get 
if you are going Force like all the non-cities or   all in on on the terraforming strategy then you 
then you are not keeping that many draw cards   but even then these three are just so good that 
even then I would still consider to keep this   but it's not a given that you keep Capital if 
you're going all in on terraforming for example   perfect okay when would you not keep card draw 
cards in yes there are a few examples like in the   late game some card broadcast they are simply 
just too expensive if they only draw you like   one or two cards so for example we have this 
card here Inventus Guild it's a it's it's not   one of the better cards it's sort of one of the 
weaker cards because it's very expensive for what   it gives you but if you're playing the greedy 
game and you get this in the beginning of game   you're of course still very happy but let's say 
we're on the second to last generation even the   last generation then you would not really take 
this card so because what is it giving you it's   like it cost you nine plus three foot card 
plus three for the actual card that you're   buying with the car so for 15 Mega credits you 
only get one card if you play this in the last   iteration so that's usually not worth it okay that 
makes sense any other thoughts on card draw here   yeah if you have a lot of if you have plenty of 
good cards in your hand already maybe you don't   need more cards but then we again back to like if 
you hand this a stack with with really good curves   then it makes sense you wouldn't really have to 
invest in getting even more carbs if you're just   happy with playing the stuff you already have in 
your hand and number three ironically if you're   um yeah and number three ironically if your engine 
is bad it is sometimes hard to keep card blocker   as this is just a luxury you cannot afford right 
now so we're back to this I I mentioned in one   of my episodes that you need a balance of both 
to make this work you need a balance of both   money income and card draw if you have like a 
million cap drop but you have no money income   it's not good but if you have on the other hand 
if you have a lot of money income but you have   no card though cut wrong then you're still gonna 
struggle like everything in life balance is good   yeah especially when it comes to one income versus 
Capital you need a balance of both to make it work   right and if you hit that sweet spot where you're 
just maximizing everything then you go to God mode   yeah exactly excellent okay so if you're all in on 
cities or terraforming what are we looking at here   yes uh so so this is the starting hand I have 
for example so in this case my hand is just   stacked with City Synergy you you might not 
see it immediately but we have the ecology   experts Prelude plus kelp farming so there's a 
loan in Fall plant production then we got even   more clear plant production in the hand and we 
got fastest we got the early settlement that I'm   choosing to keep even though this Prelude is kind 
of bad but in this case it's okay so in this case   I wouldn't keep Development Center for for two 
reasons first of all I don't really have energies   to support it like if I went for power generation 
it could be okay but the thing is if you're just   all in on terraforming on this in this case if 
you're all in them cities because this hand is so   good when it comes to cities then it's like you're 
just so focused on doing this one thing that you   don't really need to actually get any more card 
draw if that makes sense you're already like like   awesome in this direction so there's no need to 
yeah you don't need to double up that's right I   mean you could but but in in a lot of cases it's 
just a it's just not worth it in this case for   example I wouldn't keep this Development Center 
mm-hmm good let's move now to the Synergy and   you're going to focus on the colony Synergy here 
yes so what I'm looking for especially so yeah   this is only if you play with colonies obviously 
but if you are playing with colonies I just look   for a little bit of colony Synergy because it's 
very strong so here are the colonies and like as   a rule to begin the game it's very good if you 
can get some of these zeros Luna Triton Pluto   just to get some resources get some card draw is 
it really what you're looking for in the opening   hand and then of course if you also need to to 
get some energy production you could go for all   pair Kalisto if you want a terraform obviously 
Ganymede IO and then if we go to the next slide   but but basically all of these cards here uh this 
is like a lot of the the Synergy that I'm talking   about so for example we've got standard projects 
then our standard technology then all of a sudden   just buying a colony is for 14 and that that by 
itself is really good that's right and if we got   a little bit more of this stuff a little bit more 
of these cards here then we already have a decent   amount of colony Synergy and I think colonies 
are really good so if you have just a little   bit of this stuff I think you should seriously 
consider building colonies it really feels like   you just need to take a measure of what you're 
being offered find that Synergy and then start   to stack or amplify that one strategy yes these 
are definitely about just finding finding the   best synergies in your hand any of my cards 
playing well together stuff like this okay so   we've actually taken into account the cooperation 
yeah right we got some great cards most of the   time these are sort of General Car General use 
cards and then situational cards yeah it's uh um usually it's like this but it's it's not like 
a given you know but I I would say that all the   cards to the right usually I'm very happy when 
I see those but but the two cards to the left   those are very situational those are more like 
for the mid to late game to be honest right okay   very good and we'll move on to discounts now   yes so uh discount is definitely also something 
you want to look at like uh I'm I'm often talking   about that you need money income you need card 
draw especially if you want to go the greedy   game but actually what you need more than most 
is Card discount Plus card draw this is actually   way better than bigger credit production right if 
you can stack this a little bit and you can have   a lot of cardboard a lot of carb discount this 
is very very good yeah if you don't need money   to buy these or you need less money then that's 
much more effective let's take a look more at   card drawing Card discount here then yeah so 
for example like what I'm talking about this   is the third craft hand I made and it's just to 
emphasize like like all this discount you can   get and all the capital you can get this is like 
it's so amazingly strong so yeah all right let's   turn our attention to heat production how much 
is heat production worth to you in the early game   yeah I would say hit production in the early game 
is generally worth five Mega credit but this is   like only from a street like engine building 
and VP point of view like but the thing about   heat production the most important thing is that 
it's kind of bad unless it's in your interest to   actually close the game if you want to close the 
game then it's immediately better so it's up to   eight Mega credits or something it's hard to say 
but but yeah I hit production by itself is kind of   underwhelming yeah but if you want to close the 
game heat production and especially with a with   a hip heat combo then it's really good very nice 
okay and Heat's okay if you do have a combo though   yeah heat is good if you have a combo so this 
is what I'm talking about in the early game   when I'm looking for heat Synergy some of this 
stuff would be really good for example if you   have the other day I just had a game where I had 
a bunch of heat production and then I randomly   picked up insulation and that's perfect because 
now I can just pump up the heat as much as I want   and then I have this insurance if that makes sense 
to just go for installation when the heat is like   maxed right you can also do it differently if you 
want to play more greedy you can just make a bunch   of view production and use insulation immediately 
but so you get more control over your mega credit   production then yeah heat production it just gets 
a lot better if you have a little bit of synergy   to go with it that's really what I'm trying to say 
here okay and we've got a formula here yeah so it   what I was talking about like if you have exactly 
80 production then you could kind of see that it's   like worth one it's like one TR per generation and 
if we save one TR to be eight which I do then it's   basically eight Mega credit production so when 
you look at the best way this way it's actually   kind of good um so but but this of course then we 
also have to take into account then you need to   have a plan B for when the heat is maxed because 
otherwise this math just falls apart so if you   have like heliana installation okay I'll take 
a contract or something or if heat is the last   parameter to close well then we can say this then 
we can say that one Victory Point per generation   or one TR per generation that's exactly eight 
Mega credit production so it gets a little bit   better if you think about it this way yeah okay 
and you've got another cool combo here yeah so uh   like if we got extreme cold funkers together with 
either regular eaters or GHC producing bacteria   this is also like one free TR per generation so 
that's also like eight Mega credit production if   you want to look at it that way so yeah that's 
also good okay nice okay and we're moving on to   number three are my cards supporting a strategy 
now so what strategies are we talking about   yeah and basically these are the strategies I'm 
covering on my channel but the um basically the   most important ones would be the field to do with 
the terraform or just the terraforming strategy if   you want to follow that the greedy cut strategy 
and also the city strategy these are like I want   to look for cars that actually support this so 
for example if I have a bunch of cities energetic   cards if I'm fastest or something then of course 
I'm looking for more cards to go with the cap or   the city strategy or if I have a lot of engine a 
lot of card draw I might just go in this direction   to go for greedy game or if I had like the game 
I was just talking about if I just have a lot of   heat production and stuff like this well maybe 
I go for the for the for the terriform again   yeah this is like a yoga for sale is commented 
the other day that he's he's go to strategy it's   actually this mid game strategy so uh I just 
wanted to include this as well uh because uh it   actually makes a lot of sense so so what he does 
is actually he he terraforms a fair amount but he   keeps a little bit of card draw but not too much 
and then he just wants to close the game exactly   at The Sweet Spot before the greedy guy is about 
to beat him but then he still has a lot of points   to actually beat the other terraformers so it's 
a it's a risky Road you would have to be a genius   like a jack of foxelius to actually make this work 
but it is a valid strategy I think it makes sense   yeah okay and these are your three main strategies 
you would focus on then yeah we're still talking   about the opening hands so definitely the strategy 
two three four the like cards that support these   strategies there's definitely also what I'm 
looking for involving here okay very nice so the   as you can see like the filthy dirty terraforming 
that's beautiful that's a short game the car   strategy is suited for the long game and then 
the city strategy is overall also it can always   work they see the strategy yeah very nice okay all 
right so cards uh the dirty terraformer might like   uh it's just this stuff uh it's uh normally I 
would say that if you have regular Adidas or   GFC producing bacteria you would kind of need 
to have a card like the one the combo we just   showed before um the cold fungus to actually 
go with that but uh yeah and and you need   a particular corporation to make these work 
no it's just these are just examples of what   you might want to look for if you're going for 
the terraforming strategy Omni is like the the   corporation that most people like connecting with 
a terraforming strategy gotcha okay very good and   you could terraform a lot based on your opening 
hand or if you realize your opponent has a better   engine you can start terraforming to close the 
game yeah exactly that's right so yeah and so   we've talked about this as well the terraforming 
strategy is better in the bigger games four or   five player games but in the shorter games uh you 
want to close the game out uh a little quicker   yes so it's two or three player games they're 
all in terraforming strategy it just almost never   works oh it doesn't work right so yeah yeah but 
but in the mid game in the mid game strategy like   like like I talked about before that can still 
work into play games and also notably I'm just   talking about the the strategy wages right from 
the beginning just go all in on zero for me this   is what I'm talking about that's it's entirely 
reasonable even in a two-player game to see to   see like in the middle of the game all right my 
opponent actually has more luck when it comes to   engine and capital maybe I should now start 
to close the game that's entirely reasonable   that's right I'm just talking about the opening 
hand you'll want to go all in terraforming you   cannot do that in two or three player games it's 
just not gonna work I'll link two or two videos   we've done one on each of these uh your two two 
three player game you scored like 278 and in your   four to five player game it was much smaller 
score because you closed it quickly so I'll   put the links to those there so okay so can we 
look at what defines a greedy card strategy then   yes real quick first of all you need a lot 
of cardboard cards you need like a bigger   hand size than you would normally have it's not 
uncommon that you have twin cards when you go for   the greedy cast reality and you also need a huge 
engine a lot of money can come slide we just saw   and also you don't want to terraform too much 
like if you act actually yourself want to make   sure that the game drags out you can just make 
an effort to not terraform too much so what you   want to do is identify the last parameter to close 
and then you should be really careful before you   terraform that it's still worth it if you get 
like a bonus or something but just you should   really be careful if you want to go to a greedy 
late game you should be careful to terraform   and then all of a sudden also we want 
cut discount and like I talked about   before cup discount Plus Card Draw that is really 
powerful especially for these long greedy games   and then I'm also looking for resource 
amplifiers and victory Point amplifiers   so yeah this is really the stuff I'm looking 
for when I'm going for the greedy costume   excellent okay and some more strategies 
here are we focusing in on the city strategy   yeah so the city strategy and and this is 
still like the opening hand so in the in   the city strategy I I'm just looking for 
cards that support the city strategy you   know there's a lot of City energetic cards [Music] 
so what kind of synergies are we looking at then   yeah definitely just stuff that makes your your 
city be cheaper or best of all if you could get   immigrant City Martian rails or fastest that's 
really good to begin with because this is actually   increase your mega credit production when you 
play cities in the early game right but other   than that we can have there's a ton but but if 
you want to build your engine with cities you   kind of need this but otherwise you can just uh 
if you have City cards instead of just using the   standard project that's a lot better but then like 
for example if you have pits and your fastest you   just slam down pets and you don't have to go for 
cities right away but along the during the game   you just build a lot of cities and the pets 
is gonna absolutely make some points for you   okay so let's move on to Milestones and planning 
which ones we aim for yeah so also in my opening   hand I don't think you should it should not be 
like a big part of your opening hand but you   can like have this in the back of your head you 
should still like plan which Milestones to go for okay so in the early game you should definitely 
have milestones in mind and you should always   aim to get one of the Milestones that naturally 
is coming to you on your way so Milestones are   less important to two or three player games but 
they are more important for fire player games   and the reason for this is like in two three 
player games it's this course is just so much   higher so the Milestones are not that important 
in four to five player games this course gonna   be a lot lower so the five Victory point you can 
get from Milestone can really make a difference   but the yeah what I was saying before you 
really you you have to go for the Milestone   that naturally fits your game that that comes 
naturally to you because if you're like all right   I'm playing on the base map I'm going for Maya and 
then you see you have photo Space Heaven you have   early settlement all right that's two cities and 
then just build a standard project City to get the   last one yes congratulations you got the media 
but then you also lost the game so right okay   so you tend towards getting the Milestone that 
suits your build rather than building your build   to focus on a milestone yeah exactly if it is a 
five player game you know then it could be okay   to just like like make a couple of sub-optimal 
play just together a milestone but generally   speaking I would much rather get the Milestone 
that naturally fits my game that's right okay   so let's look at number five here can you afford 
to keep good cards for later yeah exactly so this   is the reason this is number five is like this is 
exactly what I want to look at when I've looked   at the four other things in my opening hand and 
the reason for this is when I have an idea of   what I want to do in the first generation then 
I can actually calculate how much Mega credits   do I have left over and can I actually afford 
to actually keep good cards for later so it's   something you might consider but just remember 
it does come with a cost like keeping greedy   cards that you're not gonna spend right now you 
can actually tank your your hand your economy a   little bit to keep that in your opening hand but 
it is worth it sometimes for sure nice there's   a there are some benefits to it but there is a 
cost so let's look at resource amplifiers yes   exactly so we got for example resource amplifiers 
it could be some of this stuff like especially if   we're still talking about the early game it 
makes sense that you would like keep some of   these because some of these cards can actually 
help to build your engine even more so this   is definitely the class I'm looking for in the 
opening hand excellent okay and plant amplifiers   yes also I think plan production is really good 
but generally speaking you want to to get this in   the in the early to mid game so if I have a lot 
of good if I have some good planned cards uh it   just could be these amplifiers could also just 
be playing production cars in general if I can   get away with it without taking my economy I could 
also consider keeping some of these in my opinion   oh okay so you were talking about the Jovian 
strategy so what are the Jovian amplifiers   yeah the German amplifiers the German is a set 
collection of this game so we got these four cards   that says you get one EP or well terraforming uh 
if you're a terraforming enemy but basically you   get one VP for each jobian you have a plate so the 
these cards are a very good late game usually you   play these in the last generation it's a fire 
mining Industries because that gives a lot of   engine as well so you could play that earlier but 
if you're keeping these cards in your opening hand   then it's like it's a card that you're creeping 
in your opening hand that you're not playing   until the late game so you have to be kinda sure 
that you really want to go for jovians because   otherwise it's not worth it but that being said 
Jovian amplifiers if you're going for Joe wins   it could be so strong that it might actually 
be worth keeping in your opening hand if you   see this wow okay but you got to go all in yeah 
if you're keeping job in amplifiers you have to   go for jovians there's no way around it it's kind 
of the same with these cards here these are like   the green tags and VP cards so to speak you can 
compare these to the German amplifiers a little   bit if you're going for green tags once again 
these are also more suited for the mid to late   game strategy um but but these cards are just very 
powerful so it could be worth to keep in the early   game as well yeah 7vp for the large Convoy and 
venusian animals yeah that's uh it's not gonna   be this like all the time but if you think about 
it it with the large Convoy if you have an animal   card where the car animals are worth one Victory 
Point per animal and you get four animals and   there's two of each report on the card and there's 
also water so that's why it comes to seven oh wow   and the news in animal I just I just put like my 
my estimation on this so I think it's not often   that the Venus go to 18 but when it does I always 
get a lot of value from the new scene animals but   once again only in the mid to late game probably 
okay so what if you're doing the science cards   yeah if I get some of these cards obviously I mean 
you you know the feeling you you're seeing some   of these cards and you maybe you don't quite 
complain in the first generation or maybe you   don't you still needing like maybe one or two 
more science tags but these cards are just so   powerful that if you get some of these cards on 
your opening hand and you have an idea all right   I can probably fulfill the science requirement 
then these cards are definitely also Worth to   keep in the opening hand really okay so now 
we're moving on to the second portion of the   video and that's the early to mid game so uh 
why don't we start with the resource amplifier   yeah we already looked at this actually but the 
definitely this is the time where I would play   this stuff so and it's it's it's a all of these 
costs by Nature are very situational so it's not   always you're gonna get good value from these but 
that being said if you can make this aligned with   your game it can be extremely powerful so for 
example if you have cocktail and you already   have a lot of Earth tags it could be like a huge 
boost to your engine the same with Like Satellites   and lunar mining like all of these cards here if 
it makes sense for your game if you have a lot   of these tags played then it can be very powerful 
for sure absolutely and we've got some rules here   so if you have a resource amplifying card like 
insects cartel or satellites you should maximize   the value of the card by playing as many of the 
tags as possible before playing the amplifier   what are we talking about there yeah so for 
example if we got the cartel and you have a lot   of Earth attacks on your hand then it makes sense 
you definitely want to play as many Earth tags   before you actually play the cartel okay just to 
maximize the benefit there yeah exactly but they   also remember that this is like production so you 
have to be really careful here actually because   there's also this aspect of remember production 
is better the earlier you get it so it's it's kind   of a balancing act if that makes sense you kind 
of want to maximize the efficiency of your car   but there's also this thing that re like resource 
production is just better the earlier you can get   it down so it's a yeah you really have to think 
about it absolutely and what's a steady deadly   combo you've got for us here yeah it's like this 
is like a perfect example of of how you can like   really go all in on just getting like a resource 
amplifier like for example medical lab is in the   vanilla set so if you get medical lab you have 
a lot of building tags you get a strong medical   lab and then you can just slam down a robotic 
Workforce to just double medical lab it can be   very powerful you can generate a huge engine like 
this easy win all right all right so in early to   mid game you you need to decide on a strategy 
and go for it so how or when do you do this   yeah so um basically in your opening hand like 
you can have an idea what you're going for but   it's not until like a few Generations in you're 
kind of you're gonna look at what everyone else   is doing you're gonna look what's synergizing 
in your hand maybe I picked up a lot of Sydney   Synergy since the opening hand so this is the part 
of the game where you really have to put your mind   all right what what's my strategy actually gonna 
be today right you might want to actually mine for   particular cards or that type of thing yeah so so 
you kind of have to go for like this is the last   chance for you to just pinpoint yourself in into 
a strategy and just commit to that basically okay   and you also need to decide shorter long game here 
I assume yeah exactly if like the rule of thumb if   you're going for the greedy long game if you go 
out the cards and they've got the greedy engine   you want to go for the long game and on the other 
hand if your opponent got the quick green curves   and the greedy engine then you want to maybe close 
the game a bit sooner because the greedy players   always gonna make the most points in the last 
few Generations so if you let it drag out that's   definitely to the greedy guys Advantage okay in 
the previous um early phase we looked at what   milestones we wanted to eye up now we're talking 
about actually purchasing them yes so in the early   submit game this is where you buy Milestones as 
well and yeah like we talked about Milestones I   mean they're really good when everything is said 
and done to get five victory points for eight Mega   credits that's of course very good so you should 
always aim to get one of these and maybe more of   these if you can get away with it and like we 
mentioned they are of course better in in five   four five player games in five player games it is 
actually just a race straight up race to get to   the Milestones as soon as possible but uh okay 
and so if your economy can handle it this is   number 10 uh you should pick up the victory Point 
amplifiers but don't play them why is that yes   I mean this is like in the same line as you could 
pick up good cards for later in your opening hand   this is like it's a little bit less risky to 
actually pick them up now here in their little   mid game because now you haven't grieved your 
opening hand so much by doing this but like we   mentioned these adjobian amplifiers for example 
they can be very powerful in the late game so I'm   definitely looking to pick up some of these VP 
amplifiers at this point especially in the mid   game but I'm not actually gonna play them like 
for example if the Jovian amplifiers you don't   want to play until the last generation except 
for mining Industries okay and if we're looking   at the green versus Joven amplifiers yeah this is 
also something all of these cars here basically   they're really good to pick up in the mid game 
and if you if we're talking about like decomposers   ecological Zone herbivores maybe also play them 
in the mid game because they can actually stack   up a little bit but but generally speaking most 
of these cards should be played like in the late   game but but that doesn't mean you can't pick 
them up now this is the part of the game where   I would pick up these cards because they can be 
very powerful and give you a lot of points later   okay yeah all right so what do you do with plant 
production when when should you be doing this   yeah I would definitely get playing production 
in the mid game I think mid game is like this   The Sweet Spot we went to get plant production uh 
the thing is at the very least you need to build   like a little bit of money income a little bit of 
money engine before you can actually justify going   for uh plants uh so I I think mid game is a good 
time to go for plant production because basically   plant production is not a way to build your engine 
it's really not it's basically a way to get a lot   of VP so in the mid to late game this is where 
you really want to benefit from having a lot of   greeneries so by this logic I think it makes a lot 
of sense to build plant production in the mid game   or in the early to mid game but at the very least 
after you have some money income growing okay this   is a fun little graphic plants are mainly victory 
points so we should think about them that way   yeah definitely uh yeah this is what I was saying 
like if you think about it it's really hard to   get a plant down in the early game and even if 
you do it it's only one TR and one TR is like   one Mega credit production so for engine building 
purposes plants and greeneries it's not not good   for building your engine so I think it's very good 
to just get plain production in the early to mid   game especially in the mid game and then you can 
benefit from uh getting a lot of greeneries down   and getting a lot of VP in the mid to late game 
with friends okay and what are we looking at here   with plant amplifiers yeah once again the planned 
amplifies uh of course really good if you want to   go for plant production these are definitely cards 
I'm happy to see all of these carbs are very good   it's not often I get a nice worms down because 
it's not often this card actually is worth it   but all the other cards here just Stella they're 
very good if you're going for plant production   okay and you also should play the late game plant 
cards too yeah I just wanted to mention that even   though I say that flame production should be 
played on the mid game maybe even early to mid   game of course if you see some of these late game 
plan cards you of course still want to play these   because these are very good the thing is it's 
kind of balanced in a way so even though that   they you need six water you need like a lot of 
heat temperature to actually play some of these   cars they're just so aggressively stated that 
it's still worth to play it later on so these are   actually very good cards you should definitely 
look for these cards in the middle again   okay we'll keep the eyes open for them so now 
we're looking at the floater Synergy yeah so   floras is definitely a thing I want to look at 
also in the mid to late game because this is   where we have now in the game so uh and the thing 
is I think Florida's Synergy and could generate a   lot of VP and this is why I think it makes a lot 
of sense to play these in the mid to late game okay so there's a few exceptions though yeah 
there's a few exceptions that are better for the   early game but generally speak actually pointed 
them out here so like if we're talking about uh   aerial mappers urea tables I have no idea how 
to pronounce this Titan Shadows Titan floating   airpad local shading Apple collectors some of 
these cars are really good in the early game   it's a bit awkward to play Titan shadows in the 
early game but just because it's so expensive but   at the end of the day it is titanium production 
so it could make sense and you might be thinking   Admiral collectors and stuff like this well why 
is this really good but the thing is this is a   there's a colonies card so if you're playing 
with colonies you also need to get three energy   production so this card Admiral collectors 
is actually very good to play in the first   generation at the start of the game because you 
you just automatically get three energy production   because you can make one Flora into three energy 
okay wow tell me what are what are the five things   you can do with the floaters yeah definitely I I 
just boiled it down to five things that I thought   is really good with Florida so first of all if you 
go for floaters you really should look for German   lanterns and floating Habs because these are the 
two Florida cards in the game where the floaters   are worth two uh or one Victory point for two 
floaters so so and there's so many cars in this   game that I can actually put floors onto another 
car so this is why I think these cars are really   good also you can look for combo so some of the 
compost for example we got startopolis enforced   Chris precipitation precipitation yeah 
precipitation yeah I have no idea how to   pronounce this character yeah that's okay you're 
here to help me English is your second language so   you help me with strategy and I'll help you with 
the English it's great all right that's the deal   but yeah if you look for some of these compost 
also this is a really good one hydrogen to Venus   and floating Habs this is something you really 
want to play in the late game because if you   think about hydrogen to Venus it's like just 
a half of a jovian amplifier especially if   you use it in conjunction with floating Habs 
so if you could get these two crafts together   it can be really strong in the late game it can 
generate a lot of loaders to your floating hips   and number three you aim to get hoverlord 
and venue file what is this yes oh the oh   the Milestone and the award okay yeah exactly 
so if you are playing with floaters in generally   speaking then it makes a lot of sense that you 
go for these two because it just goes hand in   hand yeah it does number four you're aiming for a 
card with a Venus requirement like videos animals   yeah exactly the news and animals is the big 
it's a big one I'm talking about but the all   the other that love a few walls are like Venus 
in insects and a few others but basically all   of these cards are not the impactful one this is 
definitely the most impactful one if you can ever   manage to get Venus to 18 and play videos and 
animals and you still have time to play a lot   of science text the value can get quite insane in 
other games where this card just gave me more than   20 victory points it can get quite nuts oh wow and 
the fifth time the fifth way you can use floaters   yeah yeah the fifth way you can use fluores is 
just by playing them by themselves like it's not   you don't have to go for a combo I just wanted to 
mention that a lot of these floaters are actually   quite good by themselves just the cards you don't 
like you don't really have to to have a lot of   combos to actually justify going for floors a lot 
of these cards are just solid by themselves okay nice okay moving on to the green tag synergy   yeah so at the green tax energy is 
that's actually where you just uh   you know you don't want to tear up on too much 
but you just want to collect bucks that's really   worth it about so this is also some stuff you want 
to look at in the mid to late game and once we're   talking about the green tax energies of course 
I just have to give an honorable mention to beat   Industries because as soon as we have floaters or 
animals of any kind these three cards here those   are just very very good yeah man I have to give an 
honorable nod to the pun meeting the demands for   high protein foods that's terrible yeah exactly 
yeah that's really good all right so we've got   a deadly combo here ants yeah Venetian insects 
and these two cards extreme cold fungus and bacto   viral research yeah exactly in the mid to late 
game these are the combos you want to be looking   for because these combos can give you like what 
is it like depending what cup we're talking about   we're talking about a dream called Focus it's like 
one point every generation colossal you can also   use the card by itself so it's like one and a half 
Point per generation so this can be very good in   the mid to late game for sure this is why card 
draw you told me in our strategy video that card   draw is really important to you and now I see why 
because you're looking for particular combos to to   put together so just increasing your odds of of 
hitting those so yeah definitely large fish yeah   yeah that's another very good combo so so it's 
like it makes sense right because we're talking   about the mid to late game and green tax green tax 
energy in general that's also really good when we   go when we like playing the long game playing one 
of the greedy the mid game strategy or the greedy   car strategy so when you have a lot of card run a 
lot of engine you can pick a lot of these cities   what's it called like green Synergy cards uh 
we could call it so you can generate a lot of   points by doing this so this is definitely stuff 
I'm looking for in the mid to late game for sure   okay yeah here's an example this actually the 
game we covered on your channel this is an   example of just how many points you can actually 
create some green tags yes like green sex energy   you can get quite insane so it's definitely 
uh a thing you should look for in my opinion   it's just as good as Jovian Empires maybe even 
better but oh very nice okay moving on to the   awards section yes so the water kind of weird 
uh generally I think it's really dangerous to   start these too early but the thing is they they 
start cheap right the first the world only cost   eight and then it goes to 14 and then 20. but 
I think the first one you could justify to do   that in the early mid game but then you have to 
be very sure that you're actually winning this   award because even then it's not worth it like 
you're spending eight but if you're not winning   that award or if you're not even getting second 
of that award that's just money out the window   and when it comes to the mid game and the late 
game I think this is the part where you should   look at the one that costs 14 and the one that 
costs 20. so like even even in the last iteration   am I not even like even consider the last award 
before the last generation it kind of depends on   the game of course but but I just wanted to to 
make the point that it's not like it's not that   important uh to to get these as soon as possible 
because it can be really dangerous if your   opponents are actually taking them okay yeah that 
makes sense so um back to Jovian amplifiers now   yes so uh we are in the late game now we are 
probably maybe even the last generation so   this is the point of the game where I 
definitely just want to play my German   amplifiers and stuff like this so all of these 
you want to play in yeah let's shift now to uh   the sort of late mid to late game what are 
we looking at here with Advanced ecosystems   yes so this is the last point of the menu so now 
we're talking about the last generation and it's   very important that you actually like spend these 
cards use them in the last generation the cards   that only give VP if they give nothing else except 
for VP you should play them in the last generation   uh it's just it's just the most efficient way to 
do it excellent so that covers the opening hand   the early to mid game and the mid to late game 
when you're just slamming down those victory   points hopefully all of our viewers out there get 
more victories after watching your video and just   a reminder they can go check out your channel if
