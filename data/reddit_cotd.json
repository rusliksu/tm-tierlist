    "selftext": "Hello all! Sorry for not updating y'all for quite some time. This announcement serves as a quick status update on the timeline of the 5th cycle of COTD, as well as the project that I've disclosed in December.\n\nI'd like to elaborate on the things that happened to me in the past 2 months. It has been so hectic to get through the extra workload, and on top of that, I've not been able to keep my will to even start the project. Even worse, the company I'm working for does not want to pay to renew my contract so they've chosen to not give me another year of work (my manager and even middle management really want me to stay but upper management denied the expenses). Even though this means more time to push the progress of the project, the lack of income could potentially be a problem in the future (but not the near future).\n\nIt was only until the start of February did I manage to get myself started working on the project. I've made decent progress so far, utilizing the remaining days off to get more coding done. I might be giving a few status updates in future, so stay tuned!\n\nAs for the 5th cycle of COTD, I think I'll start it right when the project is complete and live. I don't have a clear timeline to when this will actually be, but hopefully it's before the end of March. Meanwhile, you can enjoy the milestone/award of the day by u/benbever daily! I'm glad someone wants to spark some more discussion in the community and give me an excuse for being lazy (just joking!)\n\nI'll probably be back when phase 1 of my project is done. Take care and see you next time.",

    "selftext": "Hi everyone! Thank you for participating in another full cycle of COTD. I can't thank enough to all of you for the insights that you provide on all the posts.\n\nThis cycle probably contains all of the cards in TM once and for all (unless FryxGames makea more promo cards in the future, which I think is likely). Although we've discovered all of the cards, some of the newer members of this subreddit might have yet to find out what the community have to say, especially to some of the older cards after Prelude 2 is introduced. \n\nMeanwhile, I'm getting something ready to give some more resources to the community. This project might take some time, probably in a few months at least, but I don't have an exact timeline for how things might go, considering I'm facing a ton of work (and a lot of overtime as well) in the upcoming month.\n\nI'm presenting 2 options here:\n\nOption 1: Run the COTD for another cycle (probably after the extra workload settles, in February 2026)\n\nOption 2: COTD will take a break while I work on the project\n\nEither way, SHOTWs will remain up and running.\n\nDon't worry if you want another cycle but think this would take some of my time and delay the project. I can get COTDs ready quick enough since I have good automation now; and it's done on transit so it doesn't take time away from me working on the project.\n\nThis poll will end in a week, and I'll update you all after I gather the results. Thank you all once again!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/1prb0zn)",

        "body": "Lazy card with lazy art. People were disappointed in this promo because its effect is very basic, and the art is just a generic casino games stockphoto, not a science fiction casino building on Mars.\n\nHowever, the effect (mc production) is good, if played early game, preferably generation 1 or 2.\n\nFor 5mc (or 2steel + 1mc), 3mc card cost, and 1 energy production (value 7) = 15mc, you get 4 mc production (value in gen 1 ~20). That’s very good, and it’s even still playable if you Standard Project energy production for 11mc instead of getting it from a card.\n\nThat’s 3.75mc / mc production.\nAnd 4.75mc / mc production if you use SP Power Plant.\n\nIn comparison:\n\nSponsors: 4.5mc / mc production.\nAcquired Company: 4.33mc / mc production.\nSpace Hotels: 3.75mc / mc production.\nTerraforming Contract: 2.75mc / mc production.\n\nLike these last two, Casinos has a requirement. You need to own 1 city. This can be a dealbreaker early game in 2 player, but not so much in 4 player where a generation 1 city is not a bad idea. And it’s easy if you’re Tharsis, which is a top tier Corporation pick in 4p base+prelude. Like the Earth tag synergy cards, it can be a bit of an early rich get richer card, but with Tharsis.\n\nGood with Tharsis, Cheung Shing Mars (2mc) and Manutech (4mc), but can also be a reason to pick Thorgate.\n\nGreat if Specialist (10 of one production), Fundraiser (12 mc production), Builder, or Tactician is a Milestone.\n\nMost comparable to [Fuel Factory] but 1mc cheaper, has a requirement, and you get 3 mc production in place of 1 titanium production. (3mc is much easier to spend than 1 titanium, but the titanium production can be preferable if you’re Phobolog, have Advanced/Mercurian Alloys, or have Asteroid Mining Consortium.)",

In 4 (and 5) player, 2 cities in gen 1 (or gen 2) isn’t uncommon at all, especially with Mayor on base game map. Also, Tharsis is a very common pick in base+prelude. But it’s not as good as other mc production cards around the same price point, like Acquired Company, which sports an Earth tag.\n\nIn 3 player there’s a bit less chance of hitting the requirement in gen 1 or 2.

You likely won’t see cities in gen 1 or 2, and early VP isn’t valuable (production is), reducing this card to a late game 12mc for 1VP dump, which is terrible value for money.\n\nIt’s more interesting if Tactician (cards with a requirement), Philantropist (cards with VP), Specialist or Fundraiser is a Milestone.

        "body": "Basically 5 mc prod and a point for 22 mc (17 + 3 to buy + 7 for the power - 5 because you use it the same gen). \n\nOf course it is both better and worse than 5 mc prod in reality. Better because you might not have any steel targets so it becomes de facto 7 mc. Worse because you might not have steel (great escarpment, sabotage, raiders), you might have steel targets and advanced alloys, or you might be competing for banker.\n\nSetting that aside, usually the value of a point is considered 5 mc so we are left with 17 mc for 5 mc prod which is great value. I believe mc prod is usually valued somewhere between 4-5 mc which means this card is \"discounted\" by 3-8 mc. I am not sure how to value the building tag but of course that is another bonus, both for Builder and as a steel target. \n\nAnother way of looking at it is that due to the \"discount\" of 3-8 mc you get the attached point \"for free\". This really helps the card because usually you dont want to pay for a point on an engine card like this. \n\nSo in an ideal scenario where you have access to steel and don't have to SP a power plant I think it is a great value card, but it is a bit situational. Still the option to sell plants instead of steel can be good early game where the value of one plant (which could be gotten from a placement bonus next to the eastern ocean or Pavonis Mons for example) is rather useless and you need the steel to play another project early to get your engine going. \n\nMy rating, B+.

Some tags are worth 1mc or more, like Earth or Plant, and some are worth a bit less. The building tags main use is that it lets you pay in steel.

The TR gives income and VP without raising game ending global parameters. The tags help a lot with Rim Settler (2/3), Diversifier (3/8), and Planetologist (5/6) Milestone. The 2 cards can also help you get Planner.\n\nGreat with Saturn Systems (1 mc production), Point Luna (1 card) and Spire (1 2mc SP resource), but also other Engine Corps like Vitor.\n\nIn Turmoil, if Unity gets into power, you get 3mc from just this card.\n\nA bit less strong in 2 player where you generally want production in gen 1 over early VP (in the form of TR and jovian tags here). But the tags and cards can still set you up very nicely.",

I can hit Robinson with no MC prod, or a very low eco target like Ecoline with no MC/MC prod.\n3. The other corps are bad enough (like UNMI) relative to mine (like Victor) that I think paying a cost to lower Robinson/Ecoline\nchance to win doesn't make the other corps meaningfully more likely to beat me.\n\n\nIt's also worth playing to steal banker (or much more likely banker 2nd place, since first place is usually funded only by someone who can guarantee they get it) in any player count, and is extremely efficient at that. By game end you likely have leftover power, probably drew this blind from a card effect instead of paying to draft it, may have a global discount in play, and this can swing 4 MC for banker. If you pay 1-3 MC total (and lose 1 VP) to get 2 VP, you net 1 VP increase for a very good price. Taking the targeted opponent down 2 VP is \"free\" value at that point.\n\n\nSimilarly, this can be kept in the back pocket if you yourself want to fund banker but aren't 100% you can secure it without this card. Because of very low MC cost, if you have it in hand with extra prod, you'll almost always be able to play it. So you can fund banker confidently, then only play it if absolutely necessary.\n\n\nIn some rare cases, you may fund banker and actually plan to play this, but that's an edge case among edge cases. There needs to be an unfunded award in last gen with everyone else either already passed or out of cards to make funding banker with such a slim margin a good play.",

Palladin shipping starts with 36 MC +5 titanium (because it's not that flexible titanium should be valued a bit less than 3 MC but anyway) it's 51 MC.

That’s very good. And even better if you can play it with Sagitta (4mc) or Vitor (3mc).\n\nA few floater cards are great targets, can be played early, and (can) come with 3 floaters to meet the requirement: Extractor Balloons, Atmo Collectors, Jovian Lanterns, Titan Floating Launch-pad, Saturn Surfing, Floating Trade Hub (prelude) and Floating Refinery.\n\n2 floaters on these cards can be worth 1 Venus TR, 4 titanium, 1VP, 10mc, 2 free trades, or 5mc.\n\nhttps://ssimeonoff.github.io/cards-list#223#C03#C18#C44#X11\n\nThere’s also the Hoverlord Milestone at 7 floaters.

It can still be ok value for money depending on where you can dump the floaters.\n\nAnd also in a lot of games, you can’t play this at all.

If you’re playing engine with a lot of card draw, Cres Tech Market can be pretty good.\n\nThe idea is that you can play this with discounts and get the science tag/VP cheap. The card has a built in discount if you have colonies. Depending on if the colonies in play are strong (or maybe you’re Poseidon), this discount can be quite big. You can also get a discount (or effect rebate) with the Science tag (Valley Trust). Or with the Space tag via Space tag discount cards or value increased titanium. Or get 3mc with Vitor.\n\nThe sell-a-card-for-2mc action can be useless, or it can be quite a nice sum of mc.

It’s also pretty directly outclassed by Jovian Lanterns which does the same thing but faster, though lanterns is also not that great. \n\nAt its base tier strength it’s giving you 2 points (~10mc) and a Jovian tag (~2Mc) and its action. \n\nSpending a titanium to gain a TR is decent value but it takes 2 gens to do so, and the game will end before you reach a valuation that made it worth spending 24mc early in the game to use this action enough times.  \n\nAs a target for floaters, you could get 6mc off other floater cards like dirigibles, so it’s competing with that.  A TR is marginally more valuable than most other uses of 2 floaters, but again the card is so expensive.  You’d rather just have eg floating habs or titan shuttles. \n\nSo the action is worth… not much. Even worse is that the action consumes floaters so it works against you on milestones, awards, events, and cards which benefit you for having floaters on the card.  \n\nAt its peak performance, if you have all 4 Jovian multipliers this is worth 6 points which makes it worth its cost and is probably the only scenario I’d consider drafting it.",

Meaning, even if played last gen, in a lot of games, this is just 1 or 2 free mc and 2 stall actions.\n\nAnd if you have Earth Catapult or Anti-Gravity, or get Red Ships as a free draw, it’s worth a bunch more mc. Or play it as Sagitta and get 4mc on top.\n\nIn most games, the 4% Oxygen requirement means Red Ships can be played early-midgame. But in some games, when Smelting Plant, Strip Mine, or for instance Experimental Forest gets played, Oxygen can hit 4% in generation 1.\n\nIf you get Red Ships in your start hand, and can place a city (for instance you’re Tharsis) or a special tile from hand, next to an ocean, and get some early Oxygen in, it can be really solid soutce of mc. For only 5mc you get 1 or 2 mc production that builds up to 4 to 7 or more mc production during the game. Considering 1 mc production in gen 1 or 2 normally costs 4 to 5mc, that’s crazy value for money.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend adding these promos to just base+prelude. Red Ships is a bit less good if you add expansions. Except for the 3 Big Box tiles, these don’t contain special tiles, and dilute the deck. And it’ll be in the company of more power creep cards.\n\nRed ships is also less good in 2 player; there are less cities and special tiles on the board, and cities are played later. But it’s still easily worth its playing cost, except few games last gen.\n\nThis almost always gets drafted. It’s simply a bit to a lot of free mc.",

You need to buy a useless card for 3mc or get it from a “free” draw. And the pay 1 standard resource get 1 standard resource action is worth about 2mc. You pay 1mc to get a titanium, or maybe a plant. The value of the action is around 5 x ~3.5 = ~18. Add the value of 1 card (3) and the value of 1 standard resource (usually titanium) that makes this prelude “worth” about 24. About average. But pretty good considering card draw is really strong in this game.\n\nThe Prelude most like it is Orbital Construction Yard. But instead of Titanium Production, it can be any standard resource (and it’s safe from AMC), you get 2 titanium instead of 4 in gen 1, and you get the equivalent of -1 mc production (and -1mc) to pay for the action. In exchange for that you get a really strong card cycle mechanism.\n\nIn practice, the prelude can be really good, especially, but not limited to, engine building strategies. It gives 2 resources and 2 cards (1 cycled) in gen 1 which can give you a good start. Later in the game it provides production, card draw, and flexibility.\n\nIf you have Phobolog (or Advanced/Mercurian Alloys) you can get titanium that’s worth 4mc every turn (and 1 extra in gen 1) and it helps you draw those space cards to spend the titanium on.\n\nLikewise it can help Saturn Systems find those Jovian tags, and provide the titanium to play them.\n\nIt’s also great for Point Luna, Pharmacy Union or Vitor, who like a longer game, and search for specific cards, with Earth tags/Science tags/VP symbols.\n\nIt can also be a good choice for Ecoline; it can help find plant cards, you can get titanium to pay for terraforming asteroids, OR a plant if you need a 7th for a Greenery, or even a heat if you need an 8th to bump Temperature (to help with a plant card requirement or help end the game).\n\nBecause it has no tag, it’s also great for Sagitta (+ 4mc).

        "body": "Fun card, and potentially really strong, as long as you can copy a strong prelude. Even better if you play with Extended Start from Prelude 2 (where you pick 2 out of 6 preludes) or with Start hand draft (which usually includes prelude draft.)\n\nNormally, this is about as good as the best out of your other 3 preludes, meaning it’s a lot better than average, and you’ll often play Double Down + your other best prelude. Although sometimes, due to cards you want to play in gen 1, or Milestones you’re going for, it can be better to ignore it and play 2 different preludes.\n\nPrelude 2 adds a few very strong preludes, but also a few preludes that don’t work well with Double Down because they have an action or effect, or add resources to itself. (It was officially ruled that “resources to THIS card”, if copied, go to Double Down instead, which can’t hold resources.)\n\nExtra good with Sagitta, which gives an extra 4mc.\n\nGreat with top tier preludes like UNMI Contractor (start the game with 6TR and 2 cards).\n\nOr Great Aquifier. Place 4 oceans to get 4TR, 4 placement bonus and probably 6mc adjacency bonus. And if you’re Lakefront Resorts, add 3nc and 4 mc production. GG.\n\nGood with Experimental Forest, especially if you’re Ecoline or have Insects or NRA in hand.\n\nVery nice with Phobolog and Acquired Space Agency. You’ll get 48 worth in titanium (60 if you have Advanced/Mercurian Alloys) and 4 space cards to actually spend it on!\n\nInfamous when combined with Merger, which let’s you play 3 corporations. This can be pretty strong, but it can also be a trap if the corporations are low on mc or metals and you can’t get production.\n\nFlat out broken with Project Eden, giving you 2 cities, 2 Oceans, 3 Greeneries and a whole bunch of printed placement bonus and adjacency mc. Especially if you’re Tharsis or Lakefront Resorts. I’d advice playing with these 2 cards in 1 deck. Personally I’ve taken Project Eden out of the game -it has so much more value than other preludes- and replaced it with a fan made version posted a couple of months ago.\n\nFun with Preservation Program, giving you 10TR (10 income and 10VP!) but the negative effect only once. But you still lose your first TR every generation, so this has to fit your strategy (Engine, notably Pristar).\n\nMaybe not great with Recession, but starting with -10mc and -2 mc production is something your opponents will hate. If you’re going Engine with Sagitta, no harm in trying it out.\n\nGreat with Rise to Power and Septem Tribus. Start with 6mc production and 6 delegates in a party, so you can get 12mc with Septem Tribus’ action (basically 18mc production).\n\nUnfortunately, Double Down doesn’t work on 14 out of 25 Prelude 2 cards, due to them having an action and/or effect, which isn’t copied. That’s 14 out  of 68 total preludes or 20.6%. (I count a value under 15 as “not working”)\n\nCards like Terraforming Deal or Floating Trade Hub have a tag and action or effect, but no direct effects. Double Down on them does nothing, they might not even be valid targets.\n\nWorst card for Double Down is Main Belt Asteroids. Double Down ignores the tag, the action, the effect and the VP, and only copies the -5mc.\n\nUnintuitively, and unthematically, Double Down is officially ruled to not work on Applied Science and Board of Directors. It does copy the science/board of directors resources, but they’re discarded instead of going to Applied Science or Board of Directors. (However, if someone for some reason would play this, I’d vote in favour of allowing it.)",

If you need one to play a card, or to trade with a Colony, that’s a great deal.\n\nYou also get -1VP, so the “cost” of the card is actually 6mc + ~5 = 11, but the benefit of 1 energy production early game is often much greater than the impact of -1VP, which is counted at the end of the game, and -of course- this card also lowers an opponents energy production.\n\nLowering an opponents energy production can make a big impact. It can prevent him from playing AI Central this generation, prevent him from trading for 3 energy next turn, or prevent him from using a bumper card action and cheating him out of 1TR.\n\nTiming is key with this card. You want to play it before he can play a card that costs energy production, or after he passes, so he can’t trade/use bump card next generation.\n\nThe other way around, when you increase your own energy production in order to play a card, you should do it as the first out of 2 actions, before playing that card. And if you increase your energy production so you can trade for 3 energy next turn, you should do it after the other players have passed if possible. Just because Enery Tapping and Power Supply Consortium exist.\n\nThe Power tag can also be useful, for the Diversifier or other Milestones, if you’re Aridor or Thorgate, or of course, if you want to play Power Supply Consortium later (the other energy production stealing card, but that one has a 2 power tag requirement.)\n\nEven late game it can still be worth playing to deny your opponent a 6th energy resource needed for Physics Complex (worth 2VP) or to flip an Award that counts energy production or energy resources.",

This opinion is specific to Solo or TR63 play. \n\nExperimental Forest is one of those rare cards that is generally S or A tier in multiplayer, but much less valuable relatively speaking for solo/TR63 play (it's maybe a B-tier in my book, especially when pushing for high score). S-tier preludes either need good, steady income equivalents, or excellent instant effects. Forests provide a single placement of a greenery, a valuable tag, and two random cards. While decent, the cards can be completely useless until mid or late game. It's too random, especially if you have other expansions. \n\nThe greenery placement is often too early to take advantage of the best greenery chains. Those specifically  being the water walk routes on tharsis or elesium, that you want at least two or three oceans down first. You can mitigate by placing just under the two card ocean slot on tharsis, only \"losing\" 2 credits, or the plant/steel tile on the southeast of the big ocean cluster on elesium. Of course, specific cases like aquifer turbines or great aquifers make this card slightly more appealing. This is often exacerbated by the ai cities/greeneries making optimal first greenery placement in the middle of multiple potential ocean adjacency. \n\nOther specific circumstances that push this card up include drawing NRA in your opening hand, or having ecology experts as a second prelude. Being able to play NRA earlier, or drop trees, farming, or kelp forest turn one is beyond amazing, but still a dice roll. \n\nAs far as the tag, it's pretty low on the list of plant tag preludes, a rough idea is something like:\n\nS: Dome Farming, Biosphere Support, Ecology Experts(nice plant card in hand) \n\nA: Research Network,  best circumstance Experimental Forest (NRA or Ecology Experts, perhaps also Mohole area or Soletta in hand)\n\nB: Experimental Forest with lower heat source or ocean preludes\n\nC: Experimental Forest w/o any obvious heat source.

It might or might not add another generation as everyone gets slowed down a bit. If you plan to play the long game big engine strategy, Recession could help if it ends up giving you one extra generation.\n\nA social side effect may be that other players will be mad at you.

The card isn’t as difficult as the icons look.\n\nFor 14 + 3mc card cost = 17mc you get to pay 5mc (in steel) to get 1VP and 1 energy production, or about 12 in value. That’s +7 net value, so you must do this effect at least 3 times for this card to be worth the investment. The good news is that there are 9 oceans (11 on Amazonis) (and possibly 1 more if playing Turmoil) so plenty of chance to do the effect.\n\nIf you can do it 6 times it’s 47mc (partly in steel) for 6VP and 6 energy production. If you can use the energy production (to trade, play cards, or for a bumper cards) it can be great value for money.\n\nThe trick is to have steel/mc ready when someone plays an ocean (or two). Not knowing when to pay can mess up your plans a bit. But this is great for those games where you have a large pile of steel. Energy production is good early and mid game, especially if playing Colonies. VP is great late game.\n\nNeptunian Power Consultants can also be a factor for the Excentric Award.

Unlike Venus Magnetizer, it doesn't have the 10% Venus play requirement and you can just use MC instead of needing to find power for Magnetizer.\n\nAnother difference, is most cards that get better with more tags require you to already have those tags in play (Medical Labs, Terrafroming Ganymede, Cartel). This on the other hand lets you play Venus tags later to improve the action.\n\nThe biggest problem with most Venus raising actions is just how slow they are (looking at you Extractor Balloons). While this may be more expensive, it lets you get your Venus payoff card in play much sooner, and it's still cheaper than using many standard projects.",

I also have pretty decent experience with pairing this with some of the cheapest red cards in 1v1 - Virus, Sabotage etc. are very annoying to face twice. Recurring them with this card might not be the most efficient play, but you still hit the opponent more that you hit yourself and it might very easily delay some bigger plays that the opponent planned to do.\n\nYou can also get some cards that give negative points back to hand. Like Bribed Comitee... the possibilities are pretty large.\n\nAlso if you have some event cards synergies, then the efficiency of this goes up by a ton.\n\nOverall the card is mostly great in 1v1, where all the interaction cards can be re-used vs one opponent only. In more players where Virus-ing somebody is not so strong it is a bit more situational, but there are still good targets that make the card worth it. And it also has science tag!",
