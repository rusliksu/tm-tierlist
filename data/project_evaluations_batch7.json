    "economy": "1+3=4 MC for removing up to 2 animals or 5 plants from any player. In 3P: removing 2 animals = denying ~10 VP = huge swing. 5 plants = denying 1 greenery (~7-9 MC). Microbe tag worth 2-3 MC. Total attack value ~7-15 MC for 4 MC cost.",
    "reasoning": "One of the most efficient attack cards at 4 MC total. Removing 2 animals from Birds/Fish/Predators denies ~10 VP which is game-changing in close games. The 5-plant removal can deny a greenery. Microbe tag is useful for Decomposers, Viral Enhancers. However, take-that in 3P always helps the third player, which is the inherent penalty. The flexibility between animals and plants makes it better than most attack cards. In practice, the animal removal is the killer mode -- save it for end-game VP denial.",

    "reasoning": "Science tag with card draw and floater action. The 14 MC upfront for Science tag + 1 card is overpriced compared to Invention Contest (3 MC for 1 of 3 cards). The floater action adds slow value if used as floater target for other cards. Main value is the Science tag for AI Central, Mars University, Olympus Conference triggers. Without Science tag needs, this is too expensive. The floater accumulation can provide VP via Floating Habs count but this is slow and conditional.",
