## Подробный анализ

### Space Port Colony (#C40) — 93/S

Стоимость: 27 MC | Требования: 1 colonies | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1/2 colonies

**Экономика:** 30 MC total (27+3) for colony + double colony + trade fleet + VP/2 colonies (~3-5 VP in 3P). Ti payable. Req: 1 colony. Combined value easily 60-90 MC.

**Почему S (93):** Arguably the strongest card in the entire game per Krazyguy75 ('top 3 card'). Double colony + trade fleet is game-breaking value. VP/2 colonies provides 3-5 VP in 3P for free. benbever writes extensive analysis confirming absurd value. Every COTD commenter rates it S-tier or higher. 'All double colony cards are broken.'

**Синергии:** Poseidon, Luna/Ceres/Pluto colonies, Trade synergy cards, Credicor (-4 MC)

**Когда брать:** Always draft, always play. One of the 3 best cards in the game with colonies.

---

### Research Colony (#C34) — 92/S

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: Space, Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 23 MC total (20+3) for colony + 2 cards (~8 MC) + Science+Space tags (~5 MC). Colony SP costs 17, so extra 6 MC for cards+tags+double colony. Ti payable.

**Почему S (92):** One of the strongest cards in the game. Double colony ability is game-breaking. On Luna/Ceres/Pluto, a second colony doubles trade income. benbever, Krazyguy75, and community unanimously call it a top-tier card. 'Instadraft, instabuy' per COTD. No requirements, ti payable, absurd value.

**Синергии:** Poseidon, Luna/Ceres/Pluto colonies, Science engine, Colony trade synergies

**Когда брать:** Always draft, always buy. Play ASAP to maximize double colony value. One of the best cards in the entire game.

---

### Sky Docks (#C36) — 91/S

Стоимость: 18 MC | Требования: 2 Earth tags | Теги: Space, Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 21 MC total (18+3) for extra trade fleet (~10+ MC/gen) + -1 MC/card discount (~2-3 MC/gen) + 2 VP (~10 MC) + Space+Earth tags (~4 MC). Ti payable. Req: 2 Earth tags.

**Почему S (91):** One of the best cards in the game. benbever writes extensive analysis showing it outvalues Earth Catapult. Extra trade fleet is game-breaking with good colonies. -1 MC discount on ALL cards compounds heavily. 2 VP provides floor value. Community calls it 'S+' and 'Earth Cat of Colonies.' 2 Earth tag requirement is mild with preludes.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Colony synergies (Cryo Sleep, Rim Freighters), Earth tag engine

**Когда брать:** Always draft. Play ASAP when 2 Earth tags met. Top 5 card in colony games.

---

### Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid (#037) — 90/S

Стоимость: 31 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 31+3=34 MC (ti payable). Without 3 plant tags: 2 TR (14.8) + 1 temp (10) + 1 plant-prod (8). Total ~33. With 3 plant tags: +4 plant-prod instead = 32 MC plant-prod. Total ~57 MC.

**Почему S (90):** One of the most powerful cards in the game when played with 3 plant tags. 4 plant production + 3 TR is game-winning if played gen 1-3. shai_aus's sarcastic 'absolutely terrible' comment (42 upvotes) reveals community consensus that this is S-tier. Even without 3 plant tags it's decent. With Ecoline/NRA enablers, it dominates. The Space tag makes it ti-payable.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Arctic Algae, Adapted Lichen, Moss, Research Network

**Когда брать:** Always draft. With 2+ plant tags, start planning to meet the 3-tag threshold. Without plant tags, still decent for TR+temp+plant-prod.

---

### Research Outpost (#020) — 90/S

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: Science, City, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 21 MC total (18+3) for city (~14 MC) + -1 MC discount (~2-3 MC/gen for 6-7 gens = 15+ MC) + Science+City+Building tags (~6 MC). Steel payable. Total value ~35+ MC.

**Почему S (90):** Best city in the game per community consensus. No energy requirement, steel payable, -1 MC/card discount is massive over a full game, and triple tags (Science+City+Building) are incredible. shai_aus, ad_hocNC, and benbever all rate it among the best cards. Play gen 1 when possible. benbever calculates 32+ MC value if played gen 1.

**Синергии:** Any engine strategy, Builder milestone, Scientist award, Mayor milestone, Steel corps

**Когда брать:** Always draft, play gen 1 if possible. Late game placement becomes impossible. Top 5 engine card.

---

### Earth Catapult (#070) — 88/A

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 23 MC + 3 MC card = 26 MC cost. Effect: -2 MC per card played. With 13+ cards played: 26+ MC saved = break even + 2 VP. Typically 8-12 cards after playing this = 16-24 MC saved + 2 VP (~10 MC).

**Почему A (88):** Strong contender for best project card in the game. Per icehawk84, if gotten early-to-mid game, you stop whatever you're doing to play it. The 2 MC discount on every card compounds massively with card draw engines. The 2 VP and Earth tag add significant value. Per benbever, great with Credicor, Vitor, and Earth Office. Only weakness: expensive to deploy and needs card flow to maximize.

**Синергии:** Credicor, Teractor, Earth Office, Point Luna, card draw engines

**Когда брать:** Almost always in gen 1-4. Even gen 5 can be worth it with strong card draw. Top 3 draft priority.

---

### Mars University (#073) — 88/A

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 8+3=11 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 VP (5) + Science tag (3-5) + Building tag (1-2) + card cycling (~2 MC per science tag played). After 3-4 science tags = 6-8 MC from cycling.

**Почему A (88):** One of the best cards in the game. Cheap, no requirements, incredible tags (Science+Building), 1 VP, and the card cycling effect is a true engine enabler. COTD experts nearly unanimously rate it top 5. The ability to swap bad cards for new ones compounds over the game. Even ad_hocNC, who is skeptical of engines, acknowledges its potency.

**Синергии:** Olympus Conference, Point Luna, AI Central, Research, Cutting Edge Technology

**Когда брать:** Always. First-pick caliber in most drafts. Play as early as possible to maximize cycling value.

---

### Solar Logistics (#X63) — 88/A

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 23 MC total (20+3) - 6 MC (2 titanium) = effective 17 MC for card draw on ALL space events + -2 MC Earth discount + 1 VP + Earth+Space tags. Broken-level value.

**Почему A (88):** Extremely powerful card that COTD nearly unanimously calls overpowered. Draws cards when ANY player plays space events (not just you). icehawk84 says 'powerful, could discourage opponents from space events.' FieldMouse007 sarcastically notes 'terrible card design' (meaning OP). Some playgroups remove the VP and titanium and it is still a priority card. Nearly S-tier but 20 MC cost keeps it at high A.

**Синергии:** Earth tag engine, Space event strategies, Earth Office, Teractor, Point Luna

**Когда брать:** Always draft early-mid game. The card draw from ALL players' space events is absurd value.

---

### Kelp Farming (#055) — 87/A

Стоимость: 17 MC | Требования: 6 oceans | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 17 MC + 3 MC card = 20 MC for 2 MC-prod (~10 MC) + 3 plant-prod (~24 MC) + 2 plants (~2 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) = ~41 MC value. Requires 6 oceans. Insane value when playable.

**Почему A (87):** One of the best cards in the entire game. At 20 MC for 41 MC of value, the efficiency is staggering. The 6 ocean requirement can be met as early as gen 1-2 with aggressive ocean play. 3 plant production translates to ~2-3 extra greeneries over remaining gens. The MC production, plants, VP, and Plant tag all add up. Game-defining card that shapes ocean strategy.

**Синергии:** Ecology Experts, Arctic Algae, Insects, NRA, Lakefront Resorts

**Когда брать:** Always keep from opening hand. Top draft priority. Worth pushing oceans to enable. One of the top 5 plant cards.

---

### Insects (#148) — 86/A

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 6% oxygen | Теги: Microbe | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 9 MC + 3 MC card = 12 MC. Gain 1 plant prod per plant tag. With 3-4 plant tags = 3-4 plant prod (~24-32 MC). With 5+ tags = game-changing. 6% oxygen requirement. Microbe tag bonus.

**Почему A (86):** One of the best cards in the game for plant strategies. At just 12 MC it can easily generate 3+ plant production, translating to 2-3 extra greeneries over remaining generations. Game-defining card that makes all plant tags more valuable. The 6% oxygen requirement is manageable by mid-game. Weaker with all expansions diluting plant tags but still excellent.

**Синергии:** NRA, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, Heather, Lichen

**Когда брать:** Always high draft priority. Keep from opening hand with ANY plant tags. Even hate-draft to deny plant players. Top 10 card in base+prelude.

---

### Spin-off Department (#C41) — 86/A

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 13 MC total (10+3) for 2 MC-prod (~10 MC) + card draw on every 20+ MC card played. Building tag, steel payable. Effectively 3-4 MC for the draw effect alone.

**Почему A (86):** icehawk84 says 'on par with Mars University.' Subtracting Sponsors' cost (9 MC for 2 MC-prod), the card draw effect costs only ~4 MC. With ~62 cards costing 20+ MC in the full deck, engine players trigger this 3-5 times per game. COTD unanimously rates it very highly. Building tag + steel payable makes it easy to play. One of the best engine cards in Colonies.

**Синергии:** Credicor (+4 MC per 20+ card + draw), Point Luna, Big space/building cards, Earth Catapult

**Когда брать:** Always draft early. Play gen 1-2 for maximum draw value. Never pass in draft.

### Olympus Conference (#185) — 85/A

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Science, Earth, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 10+3=13 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 VP (5) + Science+Earth+Building tags (6-10) + free card every 2 science tags. After 4 science tags = 2 free cards (6-8 MC).

**Почему A (85):** Incredible triple-tag card with card draw engine. Not quite Mars University (which swaps every science tag vs every other), but the Earth+Building+Science tags make it arguably better in some dimensions. shai_aus gives it 30 upvotes calling it amazing. Steel-payable, no requirements, 1 VP. One of the best engine cards in the game.

**Синергии:** Mars University, Point Luna, AI Central, Research, Cutting Edge Technology

**Когда брать:** Always. High first-pick priority. Play early to maximize card draw. The triple-tag is unmatched.

---

### Giant Ice Asteroid (#080) — 84/A

Стоимость: 36 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 36 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card = 39 MC cost. Returns: 2 TR temp (~14.4 MC) + 2 oceans (2 TR ~14.4 MC + 2 placement bonuses ~6 MC) + plant attack. Total ~35+ MC in TR + bonuses. Space+Event tags.

**Почему A (84):** One of the best space events — massively efficient terraforming in a single action. 4 TR for 39 MC = 9.75 MC per TR, which is good value. The 2 oceans provide placement bonuses and trigger ocean requirements. Ti payable with Phobolog makes this absurdly efficient. The plant attack is a bonus (take-that penalty applies in 3P but it's not the core value). Per community, this is a top-tier event card.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Arctic Algae, Media Group, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Almost always when seen. Especially powerful when ocean placement bonuses and temperature bonuses are available.

---

### L1 Trade Terminal (#P78) — 84/A

Стоимость: 25 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2 | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 25 MC + 3 MC card = 28 MC. Space tag, 2 VP. Effect: +2 colony track steps per trade = +6-8 MC value per trade. Over 5+ trades = 30-40 MC+ value. Also adds resources to 3 different cards.

**Почему A (84):** Extremely powerful colony synergy card that generates massive recurring value. Each trade gives +2 track steps worth 6-8 MC, and with a second trade fleet this doubles. Even over 3-4 trades the card pays for itself. The 2 VP and resource placement are gravy. Space tag for titanium payment. One of the strongest Prelude 2 additions.

**Синергии:** Trade fleet cards, Cryo-Sleep, Rim Freighters, Poseidon, Luna colony

**Когда брать:** Always keep in opening hand. Top draft priority in Colony games. The earlier you play this, the more value it generates.

---

### Protected Habitats (#173) — 84/A

Стоимость: 5 MC | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 8 MC total (5+3) for protection of all plants, animals, microbes. Blocks Virus (4 plant swing), asteroids (3-6 plants), Predators, Ants. Effective value easily 10-20+ MC over a game.

**Почему A (84):** Cheap, easy to play, and extremely impactful. icehawk84 calls it S-tier. In 3P, it redirects all plant attacks to opponents, which is a double benefit. No tags is a downside, but the protection value is enormous for any plant-based strategy. shai_aus and FieldMouse007 both rate it very highly. Slightly below S because in all-expansion format attack density is lower.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Plant production cards, Animal cards (Birds, Fish), NRA strategy

**Когда брать:** Almost always draft - deny it to opponents even if you don't need it. Play when you have plants/animals worth protecting.

---

### Cutting Edge Technology (#X18) — 84/A

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for -2 MC per requirement card + 1 VP (5 MC) + Science tag (3-5 MC). At ~4-5 requirement cards played = 8-10 MC saved. Total value ~18-20 MC for 15 MC cost. Net +3-5 MC plus tag and VP.

**Почему A (84):** One of the best engine cards in the game. The -2 MC discount on every requirement card is enormous in all-expansion games where ~50-60% of project cards have requirements. Plays even better with Adaptation Technology and Special Design. The Science tag is premium. 1 VP rounds it out. Best played gen 1-2 where the cumulative savings compound. In 3P/WGT with 8-9 gen games, expect 4-6 triggers minimum. This is a top engine piece that every player wants.

**Синергии:** Adaptation Technology, Special Design, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Research

**Когда брать:** Always pick gen 1-3 if offered. Counter-draft priority. Even gen 4-5 with 3+ requirement cards in hand it is worth it. Science tag synergies make it even better.

---

### Ecological Zone (#128) — 83/A

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 1 greeneries | Теги: Animal, Plant | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 12 MC + 3 MC card = 15 MC cost. Returns: tile placement (~4-6 MC), starts with 1 animal (counts own 2 tags), Plant+Animal tags (~3 MC). Typically accumulates 3-4 VP = 15-20 MC. With bio combos: 5+ VP.

**Почему A (83):** One of the best combo cards in the game. Per shai_aus, it's a vital part of the 'holy Plant Trinity' with Viral Enhancers and Decomposers. Per ad_hocNC, it's the best point card in base game. The dual Plant+Animal tags are incredible for milestones (Ecologist, NRA) and trigger both bio-tag accumulator chains. The tile placement adds additional value. Easily 3-4 VP even without heavy combos.

**Синергии:** Viral Enhancers, Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems, Imported Nitrogen, Large Convoy

**Когда брать:** High priority whenever you have or plan for a greenery. Core card for bio-tag strategies. Hate-draft from plant players.

---

### AI Central (#208) — 82/A

Стоимость: 21 MC | Требования: 3 Science tags | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 21+3=24 MC + ~7 MC energy-prod = 31 MC effective. Action: draw 2 cards/gen = 6-8 MC value/gen. 1 VP = 5 MC. Payoff in ~4 gens. Science+Building tags worth ~4 MC.

**Почему A (82):** One of the strongest card-draw engines in the game. 2 free cards per gen is enormous value for engine players. However, as COTD commenters note, it is somewhat overrated -- it needs 3 Science tags, energy production, and a strong economy to play the drawn cards. Played gen 3-4 with good economy it is top-tier; gen 6+ it is mediocre. The high setup cost means it is not always playable.

**Синергии:** Mars University, Olympus Conference, Mass Converter, Earth Catapult, Anti-Gravity Technology

**Когда брать:** When you already have 2+ Science tags and energy production, and expect a longer game. Counter-draft to deny engine players.

---

### Deimos Down (#039) — 82/A

Стоимость: 31 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 31 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card = 34 MC cost. Returns: 3 TR (~21.6 MC) + 4 steel (~8 MC) + plant attack (~8 MC value in 3P, less due to take-that). Effective cost vs 3 SP asteroids: 34 vs 42 MC.

**Почему A (82):** One of the best space events in the game. 3 temperature raises for 34 MC is significantly cheaper than standard projects. The 4 steel returned partially offsets the cost. Plant removal is a bonus (take-that penalty mitigated because the core value is in terraforming, not the attack). Ti payable makes it even more efficient. Per shai_aus and ad_hocNC, it's a top 10 base game card.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Media Group, Astra Mechanica, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Almost always when seen. Best early for heat production bonuses, but good at any point for efficient temperature rushing.

---

### Earth Office (#105) — 82/A

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 1 MC + 3 MC card = 4 MC cost. Effect: -3 MC per Earth tag played. Pays for itself in 2 Earth tags. With 4-6 Earth tags: 12-18 MC saved = huge profit.

**Почему A (82):** Underpriced card that easily pays for itself. Per icehawk84, it's ridiculously strong for Point Luna and Teractor. Per FieldMouse007, it pays for itself in 2 Earth tags and everything after is pure profit. The Earth tag itself counts toward other Earth synergies. At 4 MC total cost, the risk of picking it up is minimal even if you only play 2-3 more Earth tags.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Catapult, Space Hotels, Cartel

**Когда брать:** Almost always pick early. Even as speculation on future Earth tags, the cost is trivially low.

---

### Large Convoy (#143) — 82/A

Стоимость: 36 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 36 MC + 3 MC card = 39 MC. 2 VP + ocean (TR + bonus ~9 MC) + 2 cards (~6 MC) + 5 plants or 4 animals on 1VP animal (2-4 VP = 10-20 MC). Full value with 1VP animal: ~45-55 MC value. Ti-payable, heavy discounts.

**Почему A (82):** Premier late-game point bomb, especially with a 1VP animal card. The Earth+Space event tags enable massive discounts making the high cost manageable. With a 1VP animal, the 4 animals = 4 VP making the total output 7+ VP plus cards and ocean. Even the plant mode is reasonable mid-game with oxygen not maxed. High draft priority card that shapes strategy.

**Синергии:** Birds, Fish, Livestock, Optimal Aerobraking, Earth Office

**Когда брать:** Keep from opening hand if you expect to find 1VP animal. High draft priority. Excellent last-gen titanium dump.

---

### Psychrophiles (#P39) — 82/A

Стоимость: 2 MC | Требования: Max -20°C | Теги: Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude

**Экономика:** 5 MC total (2+3) for effectively ~2 MC/gen discount on plant cards + Microbe tag + stall action. icehawk84 calls it 'most impactful card under 5 MC.'

**Почему A (82):** Extremely cheap and high value. Acts as ~2 MC production specifically for plant cards, which are common in any strategy. Max -20C requirement ensures early game play only. Microbe tag adds Ecologist/Decomposers synergy. Universally praised in COTD. One of the best low-cost cards in the game.

**Синергии:** Any plant-tag cards, GHG Producing Bacteria, Decomposers, Microbe colonies, Ecologist milestone

**Когда брать:** Always draft if temp <= -20C. Play immediately. Loses value rapidly as temperature rises.

---

### Viral Enhancers (#074) — 82/A

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Science, Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC for effect: +1 plant or +1 resource per bio tag played. Science+Microbe tags (~5-7 MC). With 5 bio tags after: ~5 plants (10 MC) + 2-3 animal VP (10-15 MC). Science tag bonus.

**Почему A (82):** icehawk84 says 'S tier card.' shai_aus says 'one of the best combo cards.' benbever details how just 3 bio tags + 1 animal card already pays it back. The Science+Microbe dual tag is excellent. Every plant/animal/microbe tag gives value. Even moderate bio play yields great returns. Only skip if completely non-bio strategy.

**Синергии:** Decomposers, Ecological Zone, Advanced Ecosystems, Topsoil Contract, Any 1-VP animal card

**Когда брать:** Almost always. Draft priority. Science tag alone justifies early play. Effect compounds beautifully with bio engine.

---

### Anti-Gravity Technology (#150) — 80/A

Стоимость: 14 MC | Требования: 7 Science tags | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 3

**Экономика:** 14+3=17 MC for 3 VP (15 MC) + Science tag (3-5 MC) + -2 MC discount on all cards (massive in engine). Even without discount, 3VP for 17 MC = excellent.

**Почему A (80):** Objectively one of the best cards if you can play it. 3 VP for 17 MC is already strong, and the -2 MC discount is game-changing for engine players. The 7 Science tag requirement is the main barrier -- in all-expansion 3P games it is more achievable than in base game. However, as COTD notes, getting to 7 Science tags AND having AGT in hand at the right time is rare. When it works, it is S-tier. The difficulty drops it to A.

**Синергии:** Earth Catapult, Mars University, Mass Converter, Quantum Extractor, AI Central

**Когда брать:** Always keep if you see it. Even if you cannot play it, counter-draft to deny the science player.

---

### Conscription (#C05) — 80/A

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 2 Earth tags | Теги: Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 5+3=8 MC cost. -16 MC discount on next card. Net: +8 MC gain - 1 VP (5 MC late-game). Net +3-8 MC depending on timing. Earth tag (2-3 MC) adds value.

**Почему A (80):** Like Indentured Workers on steroids. Net 8 MC for -1 VP is excellent early-mid game (8 MC >> 1 VP in gens 1-5). The Earth tag adds synergy with Point Luna, Earth Office, Teractor. The 2 Earth tag requirement is achievable with preludes and corporations. Even late game, enabling a 16+ MC card for cheap has significant value. The -1 VP is negligible when the discount enables a powerful play. One of the best discount events.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Earth Office, Teractor, Media Group, IC

**Когда брать:** When you have 2 Earth tags and a 16+ MC card to play. Almost always worth it gens 1-6.

---

### Deimos Down:promo (#X31) — 80/A

Стоимость: 31 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 31 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card = 34 MC cost. Returns: 3 TR (~21.6 MC) + 4 steel (~8 MC) + tile placement bonus + plant attack (6 instead of 8). Similar economics to original with tile bonus.

**Почему A (80):** Promo revision of Deimos Down — slightly different (tile placement added, plant removal reduced to 6). The tile placement is a net positive, making this arguably equal to or slightly better than the original depending on available spots. Same core strengths: efficient 3-temperature raise with ti payability.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Media Group, Mining Guild, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Same as original Deimos Down — almost always draft when seen.

---

### Imported Nitrogen (#163) — 80/A

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 23 MC + 3 MC card = 26 MC. 1 TR (~7 MC) + 4 plants (~8 MC half greenery) + 3 microbes (1-2 VP = 5-10 MC) + 2 animals (2 VP = 10 MC on 1VP animal). Max: ~35 MC value. Ti-payable, heavy discounts possible.

**Почему A (80):** One of the best late-game point bombs when you have a 1VP animal card. Earth+Space event tags enable the most discounts in the game. With a 1VP animal, it's potentially 5-6 points for a heavily discounted cost. Even mid-game with oxygen not maxed, the plants can become a greenery for 2 TR total. Requires setup but ceiling is very high.

**Синергии:** Birds, Fish, Livestock, Ecological Zone, Optimal Aerobraking

**Когда брать:** High draft priority. Keep from opening hand if you expect to find animal/microbe targets. Best with 1VP animal card.

---

### Nuclear Zone (#097) — 80/A

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: -2

**Экономика:** Cost 10+3=13 MC. Value: 2 temp (2 TR = 14.8) + placement bonus (2-6) + Earth tag (2-3) + tile teleport (variable). Minus 2 VP (= -10). Net: ~9-14 MC.

**Почему A (80):** Extremely efficient temperature raise. shai_aus (34 upvotes) and icehawk84 (21 upvotes) both rate it highly. The -2 VP is offset by the 2 TR, making it roughly VP-neutral while giving income, placement bonus, teleport tile, and an Earth tag. Great for game control -- ending the game when ahead, snatching temp bonuses. ad_hocNC calls it his favourite card.

**Синергии:** Helion, Earth Office, Teractor, Point Luna, Terraformer milestone

**Когда брать:** Almost always draft. Excellent for terraformers, good tile teleport for anyone. Even engine players can use it to deny opponents.

---

### Optimal Aerobraking (#031) — 80/A

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 7+3=10 MC. Value: Space tag (1-2) + 3 MC + 3 heat (~3.6 MC) per space event = ~6.6 MC per trigger. Breaks even at 2 space events. After 4 events = +16 MC.

**Почему A (80):** Excellent rebate card. Space events are among the strongest cards in the game, and this adds pure value to already-good plays. shai_aus (24 upvotes) and benbever both rate it highly. Breaks even after just 2 space events. The heat helps with temperature racing. Works for both engine and rush strategies.

**Синергии:** Giant Ice Asteroid, Asteroid Mining, Deimos Down, Interplanetary Cinematics, Media Group

**Когда брать:** Early game with space events in hand or planned. Even mid-game it's good if you expect 2+ more space events.

---

### Research (#090) — 80/A

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Science, Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 14 MC total (11+3) for 2 Science tags (~8 MC) + 2 cards (~8 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC). Total value ~21 MC. Excellent efficiency.

**Почему A (80):** Premium science engine card. Double Science tag is incredibly valuable for unlocking AI Central, Mass Converter, AGT, and Science milestones/awards. 2 cards + 1 VP on top makes it near-always worth drafting. Mars University combo draws 4 cards total. Community consensus rates it very highly.

**Синергии:** Mars University, Olympus Conference, Science engine payoffs, Scientist award, Valley Trust

**Когда брать:** Almost always draft. Play mid-game when science tags enable payoff cards. Early keep for science engine.

---

### Space Port (#C39) — 80/A

Стоимость: 22 MC | Требования: 1 colonies | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 25 MC total (22+3) + 1 energy prod for city (~14 MC) + 4 MC-prod (~20 MC) + trade fleet (~10+ MC/gen) + City+Building tags. Req: 1 colony. Steel payable.

**Почему A (80):** Extra trade fleet is incredibly valuable. Worst of the 3 trade fleet cards per COTD but still very strong. City provides board presence and VP potential. 4 MC-prod helps economy. -1 energy is painful when you need energy for double trading. Steel payable. COTD consensus: 'A-tier at minimum.'

**Синергии:** Colony strategies, Steel corps, Trade synergy cards, Mayor milestone

**Когда брать:** Draft always when colonies are in play. Play when you have a colony and can manage the energy cost.

---

### Terraforming Ganymede (#197) — 80/A

Стоимость: 33 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 33+3=36 MC (ti-payable) for N TR + 2 VP where N = Jovian tags including this. At 3 Jovian tags: 3 TR (21 MC) + 2 VP (10 MC) = 31 MC. At 5+ tags: absurdly good. Jovian+Space tags worth ~5 MC.

**Почему A (80):** The Jovian capstone card. With 4+ Jovian tags this is one of the best cards in the game. shai_aus picks it just to deny Jovian players. benbever notes with 5+ tags and wild tags it's 10+ points. Even at 3 tags it's a reasonable ti-payable closer. High hate-draft priority in 3P.

**Синергии:** Saturn Systems, Io Mining Industries, Ganymede Colony, Jupiter Floating Station, Wild tags

**Когда брать:** Draft when 3+ Jovian tags are in your line, or to deny opponents. Play last gen for maximum tag count. Ti-payable makes it affordable.

---

### Imported Hydrogen (#019) — 80/A

Стоимость: 16 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 16+3=19 MC for 1 ocean (12 MC + 1 TR = 7 MC = 19 MC) + flexible resources (3 plants = 2.4 MC, or 3 microbes = 3-6 MC, or 2 animals = 10 MC VP). Earth+Space tags worth 3-5 MC. Ti-payable. Net +5-15 MC depending on resource choice.

**Почему A (80):** Triple-function card with ocean placement plus flexible resource placement. The Space+Earth tags are both premium and ti-payable means the effective cost drops to ~13-15 MC. With animal placement (Birds, Fish, Predators) this is effectively 2 VP + ocean for ~15 MC which is outstanding. Even the plant option is decent for greenery push. One of the best events in the game because it provides both terraforming and VP engine fuel in one action.

**Синергии:** Birds, Fish, Predators, Decomposers, Ecological Zone, Phobolog, Point Luna

**Когда брать:** Anytime you have animal or microbe placement targets. Even without targets, the ocean + plants + double tag makes it strong gen 1-4. Ti-payable makes it a Space engine staple.

---

### Arctic Algae (#023) — 79/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: Max -12°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for Plant tag (1-2 MC) + 1 plant (2 MC) + effect: 2 plants per ocean placed. If 5+ oceans after play: 10+ plants = 1+ greenery (8+ MC value).

**Почему B (79):** Extremely strong when played before many oceans. 2 plants per ocean placed by anyone gives huge value -- if 5 oceans come after you play this, that is 10 plants (more than a greenery). The plants come all at once when oceans drop, making them harder to attack. Max -12C requirement can be tricky -- sometimes temperature races past it before you play. In 3P with preludes, a great gen 1 card.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Giant Ice Asteroid, Ice Asteroid, Towing a Comet, Plant protection cards

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 starting hand if -12C is met. High priority -- the earlier you play it, the more oceans you catch.

---

### Advanced Ecosystems (#135) — 78/B

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: 1 Plant tag / 1 Animal tag / 1 Microbe tag | Теги: Plant, Microbe, Animal | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 3

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for 3 VP (15 MC). Triple tag (Plant+Microbe+Animal) worth 3-6 MC in synergies. With Decomposers+Eco Zone: +2 VP. With Viral Enhancers: +3 plants.

**Почему B (78):** 3 VP for 14 MC is one of the best VP-per-MC ratios in the game. The triple bio-tag triggers massive combos with Decomposers, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, GMO Contract, and Splice. The requirement (1 of each bio tag) is achievable in all-expansion games. High counter-draft priority. Slightly below A-tier because the requirement can sometimes be hard to meet.

**Синергии:** Decomposers, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, GMO Contract, Splice

**Когда брать:** When you have or expect to have Plant+Microbe+Animal tags. Counter-draft even if you cannot play it to deny opponents 3+ VP.

---

### Dusk Laser Mining (#X01) — 78/B

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 8 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~18 MC cost. Returns: 4 ti (~12 MC immediate) + 1 ti-prod (~12.5 MC gen1) + Space tag (~2 MC). Effectively ~4-6 MC for ti-prod after ti rebate.

**Почему B (78):** Disgusting value if you have energy production to spare. The 4 titanium returned nearly pays for the entire card, making the ti-prod almost free. Per shai_aus, 'disgustingly good value.' Per benbever, with Phobolog or Advanced Alloys, you pay 2 ti + 3 MC and get 4 ti (worth 16) back immediately. The 2 Science tag requirement is manageable for engine players who already have science tags.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Mercurian Alloys, Inventrix, any science engine

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with 2 science tags and spare energy production. Still good mid-game due to instant ti rebate.

---

### Indentured Workers (#195) — 78/B

Стоимость: 0 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 0 MC (or 3 MC drafted) + 1 VP penalty. Gain 8 MC discount on next card. Net: +5 MC (drafted) or +7 MC (free draw) minus 1 VP (~5 MC mid-game). Still positive tempo.

**Почему B (78):** Excellent tempo card that enables playing key cards a generation earlier. The -1 VP is easily worth 5-8 MC of immediate tempo, especially early game where money is tight. Best use is discounting Earth Catapult or other expensive engine pieces. With IC/Media Group it becomes even better. One of the most underrated cards by newer players.

**Синергии:** Earth Catapult, IC, Media Group, Anti-Gravity Tech

**Когда брать:** Almost always keep in opening hand. High draft priority for enabling expensive early plays. Even better as a free draw.

---

### Mangrove (#059) — 78/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 4°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 12+3=15 MC. Value: 1 greenery (TR if O2 not maxed = 7-7.4) + 1 VP (5) + placement bonus (2-4) + Plant tag (1-2). Total ~15-19 MC. Great efficiency.

**Почему B (78):** One of the best VP cards in the game. Cheap greenery on ocean space with 1 VP printed. If oxygen isn't maxed, you get TR + VP + placement bonuses for very little. The 4C requirement is easy to meet. COTD experts universally praise it. Plant tag adds value for NRA/Insects synergy.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Arctic Algae, Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid, Insects, NRA

**Когда брать:** Almost always draft if offered. Best in mid-to-late game but worth speculating on early. Even without O2 raise, 1 VP + greenery for 15 MC is solid.

---

### Space Hotels (#P42) — 78/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 2 Earth tags | Теги: Space, Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude

**Экономика:** 15 MC total (12+3) for 4 MC-prod (~20-24 MC) + Space+Earth tags (~4 MC). Req: 2 Earth tags. Ti payable. 3.75 MC per MC-prod = excellent rate.

**Почему B (78):** Best MC production card per MC/prod ratio. 3.75 MC per production is exceptional. Space+Earth tags add synergy value. Ti payable reduces effective cost. 2 Earth tag requirement is manageable with corps/preludes. benbever shows it is strictly better value than Acquired Company. Must be played gen 1-2 for full value.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Cartel, Earth tag engine, Banker/Specialist milestones

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 with 2 Earth tags (or 1 + corp/prelude). Loses value rapidly after gen 2.

---

### Trading Colony (#C47) — 78/B

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 18+3=21 MC (ti-payable) for colony placement + effect: +1 colony track step per trade. Colony SP costs 17 MC, so net +4 MC for an incredible ongoing effect (~3 MC/gen). Space tag for discounts.

**Почему B (78):** Combines colony placement (which you'd do anyway) with Trade Envoys effect for only 4 MC more than SP colony. Krazyguy75 says 'the standard project for colonies is already way too cheap, yet this is a major benefit for only 4 more.' Ti-payable Space tag makes it very affordable for engine players.

**Синергии:** Any strong colony, Space Port Colony, Rim Freighters, Energy production, Titanium

**Когда брать:** Almost always in Colonies games. Best early when you haven't placed a colony yet. Ti-payable makes it accessible.

### Mining Colony (#C25) — 78/B

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 20+3=23 MC for colony placement (~8-12 MC value depending on colony) + 1 ti-prod (12.5 MC gen 1) + Space tag (ti-payable). Effective cost with ti = ~17 MC. Net +0 to +5 MC, plus colony income stream.

**Почему B (78):** Colony + ti-prod in one card with a Space tag is excellent package. The colony placement itself can be worth 8-12 MC depending on available colonies (Titan, Ganymede top picks). The ti-prod pays for itself by gen 4-5. Space tag means ti-payable, dropping effective cost significantly. Competes with other colony cards but the ti-prod adds unique value for space engine players.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Saturn Systems, Aridor, Poseidon, Advanced Alloys, Sky Docks

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with good colonies available and ti-production synergies. Best when Titan or Ganymede colony is open. Skip if colonies are full or you have no space engine.

---

### Venus Orbital Survey (#P88) — 78/B

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: Venus, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 18+3=21 MC for action: reveal 2 cards, free Venus cards. Ti-payable via Space tag. Venus+Space tags worth 3-5 MC. 1 Venus card free/gen = 3-4 MC/gen average. Break-even gen 4.

**Почему B (78):** Free Venus cards every generation is a powerful engine for Venus-focused strategies. No requirements means playable anytime. Ti-payable via Space tag reduces effective cost. The action filters the deck for Venus cards which tend to have high value (Stratopolis, Venusian Animals, etc.). Even non-Venus cards can be bought at 3 MC. Works best in longer games where cumulative free cards add up. Venus+Space dual tag has good synergy potential.

**Синергии:** Aphrodite, Stratopolis, Venusian Animals, Dirigibles, Morning Star Inc, Celestic

**Когда брать:** When running Venus strategy or Aphrodite/Morning Star. Gen 1-3 for maximum value. Ti-payable makes it accessible for space engine players even without Venus focus.

---

### Mars Nomads (#X59) — 77/B

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 13+3=16 MC. No tags (penalty -3 to -5). Action: collect placement bonuses (~2-6 MC/use). Over 4-5 uses = 8-30 MC total value. High variance.

**Почему B (77):** Strong action card that collects placement bonuses repeatedly. In 3P harder to block than 2P but still very good if played early. The no-tag penalty hurts (-3 to -5). FieldMouse007 calls it strong; community consensus is it's great early, weak late. Map-dependent value with Elysium being best.

**Синергии:** Sagitta, Community Services, Viron, Project Inspection, Land Claim

**Когда брать:** Early game only. If drawn gen 3+ the value drops significantly. Best on maps with rich placement bonuses (Elysium).

---

### Trade Envoys (#C46) — 77/B

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for effect: +1 colony track step per trade. Each step ~2-4 MC value. With trading every gen: 2-4 MC-prod equivalent. With 2 trade fleets: doubled. No tags is a penalty (-3 to -5).

**Почему B (77):** One of the best colony support cards. FieldMouse007 confirms 'strong card, easily generates good value.' SoupsBane calculates ~4 trades to profit. jaminfine calls it 'one of the best economy cards around' comparing to Space Hotels. The no-tag penalty is real but the effect is worth it. Needs energy to trade.

**Синергии:** Space Port Colony, Rim Freighters, Cryo Sleep, Miranda colony, Luna colony

**Когда брать:** When you can trade regularly. Very high priority if you have 2 trade fleets. Even with 1 fleet, excellent value.

---

### Electro Catapult (#069) — 77/B

Стоимость: 17 MC | Требования: Max 8% oxygen | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 17+3=20 MC + energy-prod loss (~7 MC) = 27 MC effective. Action: sell steel/plant for 7 MC = ~5 MC net per action after opportunity cost. 1 VP = 5 MC. Building tag for steel discount. ~5 MC/gen means break-even gen 5. Max 8% O2 requirement limits window.

**Почему B (77):** Strong repeatable economy action that converts steel/plants into cash. At ~5 MC net per action it is one of the better repeatable income sources. The Building tag allows steel payment reducing effective cost. 1 VP is nice bonus. The max 8% O2 requirement limits the play window but in 3P/WGT you usually have 3-4 gens at low O2. Energy production cost is the main downside. Pairs excellently with plant/steel production engines.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Interplanetary Cinematics, Steel production cards, Manutech, Thorgate

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when O2 is below 8% and you have energy production. Best with steel/plant production engine. Building tag makes it steel-payable.

---

### Astra Mechanica (#X51) — 76/B

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for Science tag (3-5 MC) + return 2 events to hand. Value of returned events: 0 to 30+ MC depending on targets. Typical good case: 15-20 MC net.

**Почему B (76):** Extremely powerful when you have good event targets in your pile (Giant Ice Asteroid, NRA, Deimos Down, Conscription, Solar Probe). 10 MC for recycling two strong events can generate 20+ MC in value. The Science tag is a bonus. However, you need played events worth replaying, which is not guaranteed. In 3P/WGT the card can be game-winning if timed right. Without good targets it is just an overpriced Science tag.

**Синергии:** Giant Ice Asteroid, Deimos Down, Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Large Convoy, Conscription

**Когда брать:** After playing 2+ strong events. Keep if you have expensive space events or powerful events in your pile.

---

### Cultural Metropolis (#T03) — 76/B

Стоимость: 20 MC | Требования: Unity ruling | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 20 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~30 MC cost. Returns: 3 MC-prod (~15 MC gen1), 2 delegates (~10 MC), city tile (VP + placement bonus ~4-10 MC), City+Building tags (~3 MC). Total value ~32-38 MC.

**Почему B (76):** One of the best city cards. The 2 delegates in 1 party is very strong — can snipe Chairman for 1 TR and force a ruling bonus. Steel payable, no oxygen requirement, and good tags for milestones. Unity ruling requirement is manageable with 2 delegates. Per benbever, the delegate placement alone can be worth more than 10 MC in the right situation.

**Синергии:** Tharsis Republic, Cheung Shing Mars, Credicor, Immigrant City, Rover Construction

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game with steel resources and spare energy production. Great for Mayor milestone and city-based awards.

---

### Ice Moon Colony (#C15) — 76/B

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 23 MC + 3 MC card = 26 MC for 1 ocean (SP 18 MC) + 1 colony (SP 17 MC) = 35 MC combined value. Saves 9 MC vs standard projects. Space tag for ti payment.

**Почему B (76):** Excellent value card that combines ocean and colony at a significant discount. The 9 MC savings over standard projects is well above the typical 4 MC card discount. Space tag enables titanium payment. Non-event so you keep the Space tag. Best early when colonies are most valuable and ocean spots are good.

**Синергии:** Poseidon, Arctic Algae, Lakefront Resorts, Phobolog, Miranda colony

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game when good colony spots and ocean placement bonuses are available. Excellent titanium dump.

---

### Media Group (#109) — 76/B

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** Cost 6+3=9 MC. Value: Earth tag (2-3) + 3 MC per event played. Breaks even at 3 events. After 5 events = +6 MC profit.

**Почему B (76):** Excellent rebate card. Events are generally strong cards you want to play anyway, so this adds pure value. Breaks even after just 3 events, which is very achievable. shai_aus calls it great, especially early. ad_hocNC rates it solid B-tier. Earth tag adds synergy with Point Luna, Teractor, etc.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Optimal Aerobraking, Point Luna, Teractor, Nuclear Zone

**Когда брать:** Early game with events in hand. Even mid-game it's good if you expect 3+ more events. High draft priority.

---

### Red Spot Observatory (#C32) — 76/B

Стоимость: 17 MC | Требования: 3 Science tags | Теги: Jovian, Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 20 MC total (17+3) for 2 VP + 2 cards (~8 MC) + Jovian+Science tags (~8 MC) + card draw action. No Space tag = cannot pay with titanium. Req: 3 Science tags.

**Почему B (76):** Good package deal for science/Jovian engines. 2 VP + 2 cards + dual premium tags for 20 MC is reasonable. The floater action provides card draw every 2 turns, or every turn with external floater sources. No Space tag is a notable downside. benbever gives detailed positive analysis. Solid B-tier science payoff.

**Синергии:** Jovian multipliers, Titan colony (floaters), Science engine, Celestic/Stormcraft, Rim Settler milestone

**Когда брать:** When building science engine with 3+ tags and Jovian synergies. Better with floater support.

---

### Sub-Crust Measurements (#X29) — 76/B

Стоимость: 20 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: Science, Building, Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 20+3=23 MC (steel-payable) for Action: draw 1 card + 2 VP + Science+Building+Earth tags. With 5 gens of use: 5 cards (15-20 MC) + 2 VP (10 MC). Tags worth ~7 MC.

**Почему B (76):** Half an AI Central but with triple tags (Science+Building+Earth), 2 VP, steel-payable, no energy cost. shai_aus calls it 'off-brand AI Central and quite a bit worse' but community notes the easier requirements compensate. Drawing 1 card/gen for 5+ gens is strong engine fuel. Point Luna synergy with Earth tag.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, AI Central, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Steel production

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ science tags and plan an engine game. Steel to dump makes it cheaper. Early-mid game priority.

---

### Birds (#072) — 76/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: 13% oxygen | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for VP engine (1 VP/animal/gen). In 3P at 13% O2, expect 3-4 gens of animals = 3-4 VP = 15-20 MC. Minus ~2 plant-prod taken from opponent (-5 MC value as take-that). Animal tag worth 2-3 MC for Ecological Zone etc. Net +7-12 MC.

**Почему B (76):** One of the strongest VP engines when it fires. Each generation adds 1 VP (5 MC value), making it extremely efficient over time. However, the 13% O2 requirement means it comes online late -- usually gen 5-6 in 3P/WGT. The -2 plant-prod is take-that which helps a third player, but at 13% O2 plant-prod is less critical. Animal tag enables Ecological Zone, Pets combo. The key risk is the late timing -- fewer generations means fewer animals. With animal placement cards (Imported Hydrogen, Extreme-Cold Fungus) it accelerates significantly.

**Синергии:** Imported Hydrogen, Extreme-Cold Fungus, Ecological Zone, Predators, Viral Enhancers, Ark Nova

**Когда брать:** When O2 is approaching 13% and you expect 3+ more gens. Much better with animal placement support. Counter-draft to deny opponents the VP engine.

---

### Ganymede Colony (#081) — 75/B

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space, City | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/Jovian tag

**Экономика:** 20 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card = 23 MC cost. Returns: city tile + 1 VP per Jovian tag. With 4-5 Jovian tags: 4-5 VP (~20-25 MC late) + Space+Jovian tags (~6 MC). Total ~26-31 MC.

**Почему B (75):** The premier Jovian VP multiplier card. In a Jovian-focused game with 4-5 tags, this yields 4-5 VP for 23 MC which is excellent. The city on reserved area means guaranteed placement but no adjacency VP. Ti payable via Space tag. Per COTD consensus, it's the capstone card for Jovian strategies. Even with 3 Jovian tags (including itself), 3 VP for 23 MC is acceptable. The city counts for Mayor.

**Синергии:** Io Mining Industries, Jovian tag cards, Phobolog, Vesta Shipyard, Rim Settler milestone

**Когда брать:** Late game with 3+ Jovian tags. The more Jovian tags you have, the higher priority.

---

### Ice Asteroid (#078) — 75/B

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 23 MC + 3 MC card = 26 MC for 2 oceans (2 TR = ~14-15 MC + ~6-8 MC placement bonuses = ~20-23 MC value). Space tag for ti payment. Event tag synergies.

**Почему B (75):** Solid space event that places 2 oceans efficiently. With placement bonuses and titanium payment, this is often good value. Great for accelerating game end or grabbing ocean spots. Arctic Algae synergy is excellent. Earth/Space event tags provide discount opportunities. One of the better ocean-placing cards in the game.

**Синергии:** Arctic Algae, Optimal Aerobraking, Kelp Farming, Lakefront Resorts, Phobolog

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game when ocean spots are still good. Excellent titanium dump. Great with Arctic Algae or ocean synergies.

---

### Mass Converter (#094) — 75/B

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 5 Science tags | Теги: Science, Power | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** Cost 8+3=11 MC. Value: 6 energy-prod (45 MC!) + space discount effect. But 5 Science tags is a very steep requirement. Science+Power tags (~4+1).

**Почему B (75):** Absurdly efficient IF you can meet the 5 Science tag requirement. The cheapest energy source in the game by far. Krazyguy75 says it's undervalued by 24 cost. But the requirement makes it unplayable in many games. In science-heavy engines it's a game-changer. Score reflects requirement difficulty balancing raw power.

**Синергии:** Research, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Physics Complex, Colonies (trading)

**Когда брать:** When you already have 3+ science tags and plan to play more. Keep in hand speculatively if drawn early with science path.

---

### Mohole Area (#142) — 75/B

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 20+3=23 MC (steel payable). Value: 4 heat-prod (16 MC gen 1, but ~24 in quantified) + tile on ocean space + Building tag. Total ~26-30 MC. Net +3-7.

**Почему B (75):** Best heat production card in the game. 4 heat-prod for 20 MC steel-payable is excellent. The tile on ocean space gives placement bonuses and map control. shai_aus, ad_hocNC, and icehawk84 all rate it highly. Great for Robotic Workforce copy. Enables 1 temperature raise every 2 gens. Must play gen 1-2 for full value.

**Синергии:** Robotic Workforce, Credicor, Mining Guild, Manutech, Helion

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 as terraforming anchor. Steel payable makes it very efficient. Late game it's too slow.

---

### Quantum Communications (#C31) — 75/B

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 4 Science tags | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 11 MC total (8+3) for X MC-prod (1 per colony in play) + 1 VP. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. In 3P with good colonies, typically 5-8 MC-prod mid-game.

**Почему B (75):** Powerful MC production card when colonies are heavily used. 4 Science tag requirement limits it to mid-late game. No tags is a real penalty. In 3P with Luna/Ceres/Pluto, easily gives 6+ MC-prod for just 11 MC total, which is exceptional value. COTD calls it 'insanely cheap for what it does.'

**Синергии:** Science engine cards, Colony-heavy games, Luna/Ceres/Pluto colonies, Banker award

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ science tags and good colonies are in play. Draft early if going science, play when 4 tags met.

---

### Trees (#060) — 75/B

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: -4°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC for 3 plant-prod (24 MC) + 1 plant (2 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Plant tag (~1-2 MC). Req -4C. Total value ~32 MC. Exceptional efficiency if played when unlocked.

**Почему B (75):** icehawk84 says 'very good, not quite as strong as Kelp Farming.' 3 plant-prod for 16 MC is outstanding. The -4C requirement means mid-game play, but 3 plant-prod can generate 2+ greeneries easily. shai_aus confirms it's 'great' especially with NRA/Insects combo. Plant tag is useful for bio milestones.

**Синергии:** NRA, Insects, Ecology Experts, Ecoline, Herbivores

**Когда брать:** When -4C is achievable soon. Even holding until requirement is met is fine. One of the best plant production cards.

---

### Red Ships (#X62) — 75/B

Стоимость: 2 MC | Требования: 4% oxygen | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 2+3=5 MC total. Action: gain 1 MC per non-Mars global parameter that is not maxed. Early game = ~4-5 MC/action. Total lifetime value ~15-25 MC for 5 MC cost. Net +10-20 MC.

**Почему B (75):** Incredibly cheap for the value it provides. At 5 MC total cost, even 2-3 activations make it profitable. In early game with Venus, temperature, oxygen, and oceans all low, the action yields 4-5 MC. As parameters rise the value decreases, creating a natural scaling curve. The 4% O2 requirement is mild. No tags is a small penalty. The main weakness is it becomes worthless as parameters max out, but by then it has already paid for itself many times over. One of the best value-per-MC cards in the game.

**Синергии:** Turmoil parties, Low-parameter strategies, Any cheap engine

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when parameters are low. Always pick if offered early -- the ROI is absurd for 5 MC. Becomes unplayable gen 6+.

---

### Atalanta Planitia Lab (#216) — 74/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: 3 Science tags | Теги: Venus, Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 2 VP (10 MC) + 2 cards (6-8 MC) + Venus tag (2-3 MC) + Science tag (3-5 MC). Total ~21-26 MC. Excellent value.

**Почему B (74):** Outstanding value card behind a 3 Science tag requirement. 2 VP + 2 cards + dual Science/Venus tags for 13 MC is a fantastic deal. Better than Research (which costs 14 MC for 2 cards + 2 Science tags). The Venus tag helps with Venuphile award and Diversifier. Playable from mid-game onwards since most engine players reach 3 Science tags. One of the best Venus-tagged cards.

**Синергии:** Science engine, Venuphile award, Diversifier milestone, Scientists award, Venus Waystation

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ Science tags and expect to reach 3. High priority for engine players. Good anytime mid-to-late game.

---

### Big Asteroid (#011) — 74/B

Стоимость: 27 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 27+3=30 MC for 2 temp TR (14 MC) + 4 ti (12 MC) + remove 4 plants. Net cost ~15 MC for 2 TR. Ti-payable. Event synergies.

**Почему B (74):** Strong space event for rushers. After ti cashback, the effective cost is ~15 MC for 2 temperature TR, which is excellent (7.5 MC/TR). Great combo with Deimos Down for massive temperature pushes. Ti-payable, event tag triggers Media Group, IC, Optimal Aerobraking. The 4 plant removal is a nice bonus. One of the better asteroid events.

**Синергии:** Deimos Down, Optimal Aerobraking, Media Group, Phobolog, Solar Logistics

**Когда брать:** Most games when rushing temperature. Higher priority with ti discount/event rebates. Good for sniping ocean bonus at -24C.

---

### Field-Capped City (#X21) — 74/B

Стоимость: 29 MC | Теги: City, Building, Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 29 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 32 MC cost. Returns: 2 MC-prod (~10 MC gen1), 1 energy-prod (~7.5 MC), 3 plants (~6 MC), city tile (~10-16 MC), City+Building+Power tags (~5 MC). Total ~38-44 MC.

**Почему B (74):** One of the best city cards in the game because it GIVES energy production instead of costing it. Per benbever, compared to Cupola (which costs energy), this effectively costs 15 MC for the city component. No requirements means playable any time. 3 tags are excellent for milestones. The 3 plants enable greenery conversion. Steel payable with Building tag. Expensive in absolute terms but very good value per MC.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Tharsis Republic, Colonies trading, Mayor milestone, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game with steel resources. One of few cities that doesn't hurt your energy economy.

---

### Fish (#052) — 74/B

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 2°C | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 9 MC + 3 MC card = 12 MC cost. Action: +1 animal (1 VP each). -1 plant-prod opponent. Typically 2-3 VP = 10-15 MC value. With animal placers: 4+ VP.

**Почему B (74):** Strong 1-VP-per-animal card, comparable to Birds. The +2°C requirement is often met before 13% oxygen, making Fish sometimes available earlier than Birds. Per icehawk84, Fish is among the best animal cards. The -1 plant-prod attack is a minor bonus in 3P (take-that concerns apply but it's free bonus, not core value). Typically 2-3 VP self-generated, ceiling higher with Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen etc.

**Синергии:** Viral Enhancers, Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen, Ecological Zone, Miranda colony

**Когда брать:** When temperature is close to +2°C and you have or expect animal placement cards. Similar priority to Birds.

---

### GMO Contract (#T06) — 74/B

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: Greens ruling | Теги: Microbe, Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 3 MC + 3 MC card = 6 MC cost. Effect: +2 MC when you play a plant, animal, or microbe tag. Greens ruling req. Science tag (~4 MC). With 4-6 bio tags after: 8-12 MC = great for 6 MC investment.

**Почему B (74):** Excellent value in bio-tag strategies. At 6 MC cost, paying for itself with just 3 bio tags played afterward is easy. Per icehawk84 in Ecology Research COTD, with bio combos this can get completely out of hand. The Greens ruling requirement is manageable — Greens are often in power mid-game when you'd want to play this anyway. The Science tag adds value. A mini Earth Office for bio tags.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, Decomposers, bio-tag heavy strategies

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with planned bio-tag strategy and Greens accessible. Excellent return even with 3-4 future bio tags.

---

### Homeostasis Bureau (#X57) — 74/B

Стоимость: 16 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 16 MC + 3 MC card = 19 MC. 2 heat prod (~8 MC). Effect: gain MC back when spending heat for temp raises. With ~3-4 temp raises via heat = ~9-12 MC back. Building tag payable in steel.

**Почему B (74):** Strong synergy card for heat-based terraforming. The 2 heat production alone is worth 8 MC, and the MC-back effect on temperature raises can generate significant value over the game. Works especially well when temp raises are abundant and you're actively pushing heat. The effect also works on asteroid-type cards that raise temp. Building tag for steel payment. Good floor, high ceiling.

**Синергии:** Helion, Deimos Down, GIA, Standard Tech, Credicor

**Когда брать:** Early game when planning to terraform via heat. Excellent gen 1-3 play. Loses value if temperature is already near max.

---

### Lunar Exports (#C21) — 74/B

Стоимость: 19 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 19 MC + 3 MC card = 22 MC for 5 MC-prod (~25 MC) or 2 plant-prod (~16 MC). Earth+Space tags (~4 MC). Ti-payable. MC mode: 4.4 MC/MC-prod = above average.

**Почему B (74):** Solid production card with excellent flexibility. The MC-prod mode at 4.4 MC per production is above average for gen 1. Earth+Space tags provide synergy value and titanium payment option. The plant mode is almost never correct (just do SP Greenery). No requirements makes it always playable. Great early-game economy card, especially with prelude titanium.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Phobolog, Earth Office, Acquired Space Agency

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 for MC production mode. Ti-payable makes it excellent with prelude titanium. Almost always take MC over plants.

---

### Meat Industry (#X25) — 74/B

Стоимость: 5 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 5+3=8 MC (steel payable). Value: Building tag (1-2) + 2 MC per animal gained. With 1 animal/gen = Sponsors equivalent. With 2+/gen = absurd value.

**Почему B (74):** Cheap enabler that scales from mediocre to broken. With Ecological Zone, Martian Zoo, Pets, or Miranda colony, it generates massive MC. Floor is low (need animal cards), but ceiling is extraordinary. Krazyguy75 notes it's 'never fine -- always either too strong or too weak.' Draft it when you have animal synergy.

**Синергии:** Ecological Zone, Martian Zoo, Birds, Fish, Miranda colony

**Когда брать:** When you have 1+ VP animal cards or Ecological Zone. With Miranda colony in play it becomes very strong. Don't draft without animal synergy.

---

### Mining Area (#064) — 74/B

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** Cost 4+3=7 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 steel/ti-prod (8-12.5) + placement bonus (2-3) + Building tag (1-2). Total ~11-17 MC. Net +4-10 MC.

**Почему B (74):** One of the best production cards when placement is available. Requires a tile next to your own on a mineral spot, which limits early-game use. On titanium it's phenomenal (12.5 MC value for 7 MC cost). shai_aus rates it S-tier for Mining Guild. The tile placement is bonus value for milestones/awards.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Phobolog, Manutech, Philares, Mining Rights

**Когда брать:** When you have a tile adjacent to a mineral spot. Prioritize titanium over steel. Keep in opening hand.

---

### Robotic Workforce (#086) — 74/B

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 12 MC total (9+3) for duplicating a building card's production box. Science tag worth ~3-5 MC. Value depends entirely on target card. Best targets: Mohole Area (4 heat prod), Fusion Power (3 energy), Medical Lab, Tectonic Stress Power.

**Почему B (74):** Excellent when you have a strong building production card to copy. Science tag is very valuable. benbever lists many great targets. The card is never bad as a 12 MC science tag, and can be game-changing when copying Mohole Area or similar. shai_aus notes it copies ALL production including costs.

**Синергии:** Mohole Area, Fusion Power, Field Capped City, Cheung Shing Mars, Utopia Invest

**Когда брать:** Draft when you have good building cards with production boxes. Play after the target card is played.

---

### Sulphur-Eating Bacteria (#251) — 74/B

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 6% Venus | Теги: Venus, Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for ~3 MC equivalent production per gen (action: add microbe or cash out at 3 MC each). Venus+Microbe tags worth ~3-4 MC. With Enceladus colony: explosive income potential.

**Почему B (74):** Effectively 3 MC-prod for 9 MC is excellent. icehawk84 says it can net 30-40 MC. FieldMouse007 notes it's much worse than real income because you must wait before cashing out. Enceladus colony makes this card broken. Venus 6% requirement limits early play but is usually achievable by gen 2-3 with WGT.

**Синергии:** Enceladus colony, Extreme-Cold Fungus, Topsoil Contract, Symbiotic Fungus, Psychrophiles

**Когда брать:** Almost always when Venus 6% is met or close. Especially strong with Enceladus colony. Draft early, play when requirement is met.

### Topsoil Contract (#X30) — 74/B

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Microbe, Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for 3 plants (6 MC) + effect: gain 1 MC per microbe added anywhere + Microbe+Earth tags (~4 MC). Base value 10 MC. With 2+ microbe actions/gen: 2+ MC-prod equivalent.

**Почему B (74):** Excellent combo card. shai_aus gives high draft priority. The 3 plants + Earth tag already justify most of the cost. The microbe rebate effect can generate 10-40+ MC over a game with the right engine. icehawk84 says 'not very strong but 3 instant plants and a bio tag for 11 MC is not bad with synergies.' Strong with Enceladus.

**Синергии:** Enceladus colony, Decomposers, Psychrophiles, Sulphur-Eating Bacteria, Viral Enhancers

**Когда брать:** Almost always when you have or plan to have microbe generation. Even without, 3 plants + Earth tag is decent.

### Open City (#108) — 74/B

Стоимость: 23 MC | Требования: 12% oxygen | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 23+3=26 MC - energy-prod (~7 MC) = 33 MC effective. City tile adjacency (2-4 MC from greeneries) + 4 MC-prod (20-24 MC gen 1-3) + 2 plants (1.6 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC). City+Building tags for steel. Total value ~30-35 MC. Net -3 to +2 MC but with city tile value.

**Почему B (74):** The best base-game city card. 4 MC-prod is the highest on any city card and the Building tag means steel-payable. The 12% O2 requirement means it comes gen 4-6 in 3P/WGT. 2 plants helps toward greenery. City placement near own greeneries adds adjacency VP. The energy-prod cost is standard for cities. Steel-payable via Building+City tags significantly reduces effective cost. Late-game timing is the main drawback -- the MC-prod has fewer gens to pay off.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Rover Construction, Mayor milestone, Landlord award, Manutech

**Когда брать:** Gen 4-6 when O2 approaches 12% and you have energy-prod and steel. Best city in base game for pure economy. Steel dump priority.

### Sponsoring Nation (#P83) — 74/B

Стоимость: 21 MC | Требования: 4 Earth tags | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 21+3=24 MC for 3 TR (21-22.2 MC) + 2 delegates (6-8 MC Turmoil value) + Earth tag (2-3 MC). Total value ~30-33 MC. Net +6-9 MC. Requires 4 Earth tags which is achievable but not trivial.

**Почему B (74):** 3 TR is massive value equivalent to ~21 MC. The 2 delegates on top provide party control which is worth 3-4 MC each in Turmoil games. Earth tag adds to count for future cards. The 4 Earth tag requirement is the main gate -- you need significant Earth investment, but with Point Luna, Teractor, or Earth Office this is very achievable. In 3P/WGT Turmoil games, this card is a powerhouse for Earth-focused players. Without Turmoil it loses the delegate value and drops to C-tier.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Luna Metropolis, Luna Governor, Cartel

**Когда брать:** Mid-game (gen 3-5) when you have 3+ Earth tags and Turmoil is active. Top priority for Earth engine players. Skip without Turmoil or insufficient Earth tags.

---

### Algae (#047) — 73/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: 5 oceans | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 2 plant-prod (16 MC gen 1) + 1 plant (2 MC) + Plant tag (1-2 MC). Total ~19 MC. Excellent value at 5.5 MC/plant-prod.

**Почему B (73):** One of the best plant production cards. 2 plant-prod + 1 plant for only 13 MC is great value. The 5 ocean requirement is achievable gen 2-4 in 3P with preludes (ocean preludes are common). Plant tag enables NRA, Insects, Ecologist. The main risk is oceans being slow, making the card dead in hand. In 3P/WGT oceans usually come out reasonably fast.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Insects, Ecoline, Arctic Algae, Robot Pollinators

**Когда брать:** When 5 oceans will be met gen 2-4 and you want greeneries. Speculate early if ocean preludes are played.

---

### Energy Market (#X03) — 73/B

Стоимость: 3 MC | Теги: Power | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 3 MC + 3 MC card = 6 MC cost. Action: sell energy-prod for 8 MC or buy energy for 2 MC each. Power tag (~1 MC). With 3 excess energy-prod sold: 24 MC over last 3 gens.

**Почему B (73):** Extremely cheap card with surprisingly strong flexibility. Per FieldMouse007, the sell-energy-production action is the real strength — turning excess production into 8 MC per gen in the endgame is very efficient. Per benbever, enables great combos with Space Mirrors and Fusion Power. With Colonies, buying energy to trade is valuable. The Power tag is rare and occasionally needed. A classic 'underrated cheap action card.'

**Синергии:** Mass Converter, Quantum Extractor, Fusion Power, Colonies trading, Steelworks

**Когда брать:** Almost always worth picking up for 6 MC total cost. Especially good with Colonies or energy-heavy engines.

---

### Frontier Town (#P74) — 73/B

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: Mars First ruling | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 11 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~21 MC cost. Returns: city tile + 3x PRINTED placement bonus. Typical bonus ~12 MC (triple 2 plants or 2 steel). City+Building tags.

**Почему B (73):** Incredible ceiling depending on map spot. Per benbever's exhaustive analysis, some maps have crazy spots — Elysium 9 plants (instant greenery), Terra Cimmeria 3 colonies for 15 MC, Vastitas 3 temperature raises. The Mars First requirement is manageable with 2 delegates. Average case: triple a 2-plant spot = 6 plants + city, which is strong. Below average case: 21 MC for a city + 6 MC bonus, which is fine.

**Синергии:** Tharsis Republic, Mining Guild, specific map spots, Mars First party, Mayor milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with a strong printed placement bonus spot available. Check map before drafting.

---

### Interplanetary Colony Ship (#C17) — 73/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Space, Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 12 MC + 3 MC card = 15 MC for 1 colony (SP 17 MC). Saves 2 MC minimum. Earth+Space event tags enable discounts. Ti-payable. With discounts: can be nearly free.

**Почему B (73):** Solid colony placement at a discount. Even without synergies it's 2 MC cheaper than standard project. Earth+Space event tags open up massive discount possibilities. Titanium payable. In Colonies format, colony placement is very valuable early game. One of several efficient colony cards that make the expansion strong.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Earth Office, Media Group, IC, Poseidon

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game when colony spots are still valuable. Great with event/space discounts. Standard titanium dump.

---

### Interstellar Colony Ship (#027) — 73/B

Стоимость: 24 MC | Требования: 5 Science tags | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 4

**Экономика:** 24 MC + 3 MC card = 27 MC base. 4 VP. Requires 5 Science tags. At base price: 6.75 MC/VP = ok. With titanium + discounts: can drop to 10-15 MC effective = excellent.

**Почему B (73):** Heavily overpriced at face value but designed to be played with massive discounts. Science engine players typically have Earth Office, space discounts, and leftover titanium by late game. The 4 VP is the highest single-card VP without card draw. The 5 Science requirement is the main barrier but usually met by science engine players. Good last-gen titanium dump.

**Синергии:** Earth Office, Warp Drive, Mass Converter, Optimal Aerobraking, Phobolog

**Когда брать:** When playing science engine and have 4+ Science tags. Hold for last gen titanium dump with discounts. Don't play at full price.

---

### Martian Media Center (#T07) — 73/B

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: Mars First ruling | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** Cost 7+3=10 MC (steel payable). Value: 2 MC-prod (10-12) + action saves 2 MC/gen on delegates. Building tag (1-2). Over 4 gens, action saves 8 MC.

**Почему B (73):** Excellent value when Mars First is accessible. The 2 MC-prod alone nearly pays for the card, and the cheap delegate action (3 MC instead of 5) adds up significantly. Building tag is good. The party requirement is manageable in 3P since Mars First is popular. benbever rates it highly.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Tharsis Republic, Mars First party cards, Robotic Workforce, Credicor

**Когда брать:** When Mars First is ruling or you have 2 delegates there. Best early game for maximum production value.

---

### Stratospheric Birds (#249) — 73/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 12% Venus | Теги: Venus, Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC + 1 floater cost for 1 VP/animal action. Venus+Animal tags worth ~3-4 MC. 3 gens remaining = 3 VP (15 MC value). With animal placers: 5+ VP ceiling.

**Почему B (73):** Strong 1-VP-per-animal card but held back by dual requirements: 12% Venus AND spending a floater. In all-expansions play, Venus often stays low making this unplayable. When it works, it's very strong - comparable to Birds. Venus+Animal dual tag is great for Ecologist and Freyja Biodomes.

**Синергии:** Freyja Biodomes, Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen, Maxwell Base, Decomposers

**Когда брать:** When Venus is at/near 12% and you have a floater to spend. High priority if requirements are met, skip if Venus is ignored.

---

### Terraforming Contract (#252) — 73/B

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: TR 25 | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for 4 MC-prod (20-24 MC) + Earth tag (~2-3 MC). 2.75 MC/prod is excellent. Req TR 25 (hard with Turmoil but doable gen 1-2 with preludes).

**Почему B (73):** One of the best MC production efficiency cards in the game. ad_hocNC confirms 'quite good' and notes preludes make the requirement easy. icehawk84 says 'can be playable even mid-game.' The Earth tag adds Point Luna/Teractor synergy. Turmoil makes TR 25 harder but still achievable.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Manutech, Banker award

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when TR 25 is achievable. With terraforming preludes it's nearly free to meet. Even gen 4-5 if not too late.

---

### Warp Drive (#C49) — 73/B

Стоимость: 14 MC | Требования: 5 Science tags | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 14+3=17 MC for effect: -2 MC on Space tag cards + 2 VP (10 MC) + Science tag (~3-5 MC). Req 5 Science tags. Effective discount cost: 17-10-4 = 3 MC for the discount. Need 2 space cards to break even.

**Почему B (73):** Krazyguy75 says 'no brainer if you have the requirement, don't pick if you don't.' 5 Science tags is steep but science engines naturally accumulate them. shai_aus prefers Mass Converter but this is still strong. 2 VP is excellent. Late-gen space card dumps (Interstellar Colony Ship, Large Convoy) benefit greatly.

**Синергии:** Mass Converter, Large Convoy, Interstellar Colony Ship, Imported Nitrogen, Science engine

**Когда брать:** When you have 4+ science tags. Auto-play. The 2 VP + discount pays immediately with any space card.

---

### Asteroid Rights (#X34) — 72/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for Earth tag (2-3 MC) + Space tag (1-2 MC) + 2 asteroids (6 MC ti) immediate. Action: spend 1 MC = gain 1 ti or spend asteroids for MC-prod. Fast payoff.

**Почему B (72):** Excellent fast-payoff economy card. The 2 immediate asteroids give 6 MC in ti, and the action provides flexible conversion between MC-prod and ti production. Pays for itself in ~2 gens even without synergy. Earth + Space dual tag adds value. The main weakness is that the individual actions are small -- each conversion is only ~3 MC of value. But the efficiency is very high for the cost.

**Синергии:** Astrodrill, Comet Aiming, Directed Impactors, Point Luna, Phobolog

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-5 when you have space card targets for titanium. Good fast economy even without asteroid synergy.

---

### Carbon Nanosystems (#X52) — 72/B

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 14+3=17 MC (steel-payable) for Science+Building tags (4-7 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + 1 graphene immediately. Each future Science tag = 4 MC for space/city cards. 3+ more science tags = breakeven.

**Почему B (72):** Strong science engine card that generates 4 MC graphene per science tag played. Steel-payable makes the upfront cost easier. No requirements. With 4+ science tags after playing this, you accumulate 16+ MC to spend on space/city cards. The Science + Building dual tag is valuable. Compared to Earth Catapult/AGT it is less powerful but much easier to play. Good for science players who will play multiple science tags.

**Синергии:** Science engine cards, Space cards, City cards, Mars University, Olympus Conference

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-4 when building science engine and expect 3+ more science tags. Steel-payable is a big plus.

---

### Caretaker Contract (#154) — 72/B

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: 0°C | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 3+3=6 MC for action: spend 8 heat -> 1 TR (7 MC). Requires 0C. At 1 heat = ~0.5 MC, 8 heat = 4 MC for 7 MC TR. Net ~3 MC/action. No tags = -3 penalty.

**Почему B (72):** Strong conversion action that turns heat into TR at a favorable rate. 8 heat for 1 TR is essentially 4 MC for 7 MC. The 0C requirement means mid-to-late game (gen 4-6 typically). The no-tag penalty is offset by the extremely low play cost (6 MC) and strong ongoing action. Every heat-producing player wants this card. Also functions as a stalling action. With Helion it is exceptional.

**Синергии:** Helion, Heat production cards, Generalist milestone, Stalling

**Когда брать:** When you have 8+ heat production per gen and 0C is close. Essential for heat strategies. Low draft cost.

---

### Comet (#010) — 72/B

Стоимость: 21 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 21+3=24 MC for 1 temp TR (7 MC) + 1 ocean TR (7 MC) + placement bonus (~2-4 MC) + 3 plant removal. Net cost ~7-10 MC for 2 TR. Ti-payable.

**Почему B (72):** Good dual-terraforming event. 2 TR + ocean placement for 24 MC is decent value, especially with ti payment. Less impactful than Deimos Down or Giant Ice Asteroid but cheaper and easier to time. Plant removal is a nice bonus. Excellent with Optimal Aerobraking (+3 heat, +3 MC) and Arctic Algae (+2 plants from ocean). A solid, reliable space event for terraform-focused strategies.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Arctic Algae, Media Group, Phobolog, Solar Logistics

**Когда брать:** Most games when terraforming. Higher priority with space/event discounts. Good for controlling game pace.

---

### Decomposers (#131) — 72/B

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 3% oxygen | Теги: Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/3 resources

**Экономика:** 5 MC + 3 MC card = 8 MC cost. Counts own tag. With 6-9 bio tags played after: 2-3 VP = 10-15 MC value. With Enceladus or microbe placers: 3-4+ VP.

**Почему B (72):** Cheap VP accumulator that scales with bio tags. At 8 MC for typically 2-3 VP, it's efficient. The Microbe tag itself counts, so you start at 1/3 already. Great with Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, and colony Enceladus. Per community consensus, regularly worth 2-3 VP in 3P which is solid for the investment.

**Синергии:** Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, Advanced Ecosystems, Enceladus colony, Imported Nitrogen

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game when planning bio tag strategy. Great if you already have or expect 4+ bio tags.

---

### Ecology Research (#C09) — 72/B

Стоимость: 21 MC | Теги: Science, Plant, Animal, Microbe | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 21 MC + 3 MC card = 24 MC cost. Returns: X plant-prod (X = colonies owned, usually 1-2 = 8-16 MC gen1), 1 animal (~5 MC), 2 microbes (~3 MC), 1 VP, 4 tags (Science+Plant+Animal+Microbe = ~10 MC). Total ~26-34 MC.

**Почему B (72):** Quad-tag monster with strong bio synergy potential. Per icehawk84, with bio combos this can be a huge 5+ point bomb. The 4 unique tags can steal Diversifier and enable Ecologist. Per community, the plant production scales with colonies. The animal and microbe placement adds value with the right targets. Slightly overpriced without colonies but the tags alone are nearly worth the cost.

**Синергии:** Viral Enhancers, Decomposers, Ecological Zone, GMO Contract, Diversifier milestone

**Когда брать:** Mid game with 1-2 colonies and bio-tag targets for the animal and microbes. Excellent for Diversifier snipes.

---

### Event Analysts (#T05) — 72/B

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: Scientists ruling | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 5 MC + 3 MC card = 8 MC cost. Returns: +1 influence permanent (~2-3 MC per gen) + Science tag (~4 MC). Pays for itself in ~2-3 gens. Scientists ruling requirement manageable.

**Почему B (72):** Great value for Turmoil games. Permanent +1 influence protects against negative global events and boosts positive ones. Per benbever, cheap science tag plus 1 influence is good value for money. Per community, it's a no-brainer to play early-mid game. The Scientists requirement adds some friction but placing 2 delegates in Scientists is often worth it anyway for the policy.

**Синергии:** Science engine, Turmoil-heavy games, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Scientist award

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-5 in Turmoil games. The earlier the better for compound value from influence.

---

### Harvest (#X37) — 72/B

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: 3 greeneries | Теги: Plant | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 4 MC + 3 MC card cost = 7 MC. Gain 12 MC = net +5 MC profit. Requirement: 3 greeneries, typically met by gen 5-7. Plant tag adds ~2 MC value. Event tag for Legend/Media Group.

**Почему B (72):** Essentially free money with a Plant tag once requirement is met. Low priority in draft but almost always playable by end of game. The +5 MC net is modest but the Plant tag and event synergies push it up. Great as a free draw.

**Синергии:** Media Group, IC, Ecological Zone, GMO Contract, Decomposers

**Когда брать:** Always keep if drawn free. Draft if playing plant strategy or need event count. Don't prioritize over key engine pieces.

---

### Imported Nutrients (#X22) — 72/B

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 14 MC + 3 MC card = 17 MC for 4 plants (~8 MC) + 4 microbes (1-2 VP = 5-10 MC on good targets). Earth+Space event = heavy discounts. Ti-payable.

**Почему B (72):** Solid Earth+Space event with good value when you have a microbe target. 4 plants for instant greenery conversion is strong. The triple-tag (Earth, Space, Event) opens massive discount possibilities. With Ants or Venusian Insects the microbes are worth 2 VP. Even without microbe target, the plants + discounts can make this worthwhile.

**Синергии:** Psychrophiles, Ants, Decomposers, Optimal Aerobraking, Earth Office

**Когда брать:** When you have a good microbe target or heavy discount infrastructure. Great titanium dump. Solid mid-late game play.

---

### Kaguya Tech (#X58) — 72/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: City, Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 10 MC + 3 MC card = 13 MC for 2 MC-prod (~10 MC) + 1 card (~3 MC) + convert greenery to city (net VP depends on position: typically 1-3 VP swing). City+Plant tags.

**Почему B (72):** Unique and fun card that converts one of your greeneries into a city. The MC production and card draw add base value, while the greenery-to-city conversion can create devastating VP swings in tight games (stealing adjacency points from opponents). City+Plant tags are unusual and valuable. Requires having a greenery in play. Best played late for surprise point flips.

**Синергии:** Plant strategy, Mayor milestone, Landlord award, City adjacency

**Когда брать:** When you have greeneries in play and can create a VP swing with city placement. Great surprise last-gen play.

---

### Livestock (#184) — 72/B

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: 9% oxygen | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 13 MC + 3 MC card = 16 MC. 9% oxygen req. -1 plant prod + 2 MC-prod. Action: +1 animal. 1 VP/animal. Self-scores 3-4 VP. With animal placers: 5-8+ VP.

**Почему B (72):** Solid 1VP-per-animal card comparable to Birds and Fish. The -1 plant prod self-attack is a downside vs Birds' opponent plant prod attack, but 2 MC-prod partially compensates. Playable slightly earlier than Birds (9% vs 13%). The key value is as an animal placement target for Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen, Miranda colony. One of only 4 base game 1VP animals.

**Синергии:** Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen, Viral Enhancers, Miranda colony, Meat Industries

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game when you need a 1VP animal target. Slightly weaker than Birds/Fish but still strong. Keep if you have animal placement cards.

---

### Lunar Mining (#C22) — 72/B

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC for 1 ti-prod per 2 Earth tags. With 4 Earth tags (incl this): 2 ti-prod (~25 MC). With 6+: 3 ti-prod (~37.5 MC). Earth tag.

**Почему B (72):** Extremely powerful with Earth tag density but weak without it. At 2+ ti-prod it's excellent value. Point Luna or Teractor can easily hit 3+ ti-prod. The Earth tag itself counts, making it slightly self-enabling. Can become a game-defining engine piece for Earth-heavy strategies. Important hate-draft target - don't pass to the Earth tag player.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Advanced Alloys, Space card strategy

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ Earth tags (including this). Hate-draft from Earth tag players. Excellent Point Luna/Teractor piece.

---

### Mercurian Alloys (#X07) — 72/B

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 3+3=6 MC (ti payable). Value: Space tag (1-2) + titanium worth +1 each. With 6 titanium used = 6 MC extra value. With 12+ titanium = 12+ MC.

**Почему B (72):** Extremely cheap for a powerful ongoing effect. 2 Science tags is a manageable requirement. Makes every titanium resource worth 25% more. Scales beautifully with Phobolog, titanium production, and ti-heavy strategies. benbever provides detailed analysis showing excellent synergies with ti-production preludes.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Io Mining Industries, Asteroid Mining, Acquired Space Agency

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ science tags and titanium production/resources. Cheap space tag for milestones too.

---

### Penguins (#212) — 72/B

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: 8 oceans | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** Cost 7+3=10 MC. Value: 1 VP/animal. At 3 animals = 3 VP (15 MC). At 5 = 5 VP (25 MC). Req: 8 oceans. Animal tag (1-2).

**Почему B (72):** Cheapest 1VP animal card with a manageable requirement (8 oceans, usually met gen 5-7 in 3P). Self-generates 3-4 VP over typical game. With animal placement (Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen) ceiling is higher. shai_aus rates it probably the best 1VP animal for Inventrix. Follows the 1VP-per-animal = B-tier calibration.

**Синергии:** Inventrix, Large Convoy, Imported Nitrogen, Miranda colony, Meat Industry

**Когда брать:** Mid-game when 8 oceans are close. Good animal dump target. With Inventrix playable much earlier.

---

### Predators (#024) — 72/B

Стоимость: 14 MC | Требования: 11% oxygen | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 17 MC total (14+3) for ~5 VP average when played. 11% oxygen = mid-late game. Eats opponent animals for 2-point swings per action.

**Почему B (72):** High ceiling VP card that averages around 5 VP when played according to icehawk84. The threat of Predators suppresses opponent animal play, which has meta value. 11% oxygen requirement limits timing. In 3P, eating one opponent's animals benefits the third. Still strong as a VP generator and deterrent.

**Синергии:** Meat Industries, Ecological Zone, Protected Habitats (counter), Inventrix

**Когда брать:** Draft early to suppress opponent animal play. Play when 11% oxygen is close and opponents have unprotected animals.

---

### Research Coordination (#P40) — 72/B

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Wild | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude

**Экономика:** 7 MC total (4+3) for a Wild tag. Wild tag is worth ~3-5 MC per use. Enables milestone claims, card requirements, tag-counting effects.

**Почему B (72):** The Wild tag is the most versatile tag in the game. 7 MC for essentially any tag you need is strong. shai_aus gives it high praise. Particularly valuable for milestones (Builder, Ecologist, Diversifier) and unlocking science-gated cards. Does not count for awards (end of game). Krazyguy75 calls it 'solid B tier.'

**Синергии:** NRA (extra plant tag), Insects, Terraforming Ganymede, Science requirements, Milestone claims

**Когда брать:** Early game when the wild tag can unlock multiple plays throughout the game. Less valuable late.

---

### Restricted Area (#199) — 72/B

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 14 MC total (11+3) for tile placement (~4 MC) + Science tag (~3 MC) + Action: 2 MC -> 1 card (~2 MC profit/use). Need ~5 uses to break even on action cost.

**Почему B (72):** Good engine card for card draw. Science tag without requirements is valuable. Tile placement provides board presence and bonuses. 2 MC/card draw is reasonable rate. icehawk84 notes 5 uses needed to break even. FieldMouse007 is less enthusiastic, calling it 'mediocre,' but ad_hocNC says it is 'one of the best blue card draw cards.' Best for engine strategies.

**Синергии:** Engine strategies, Science milestones, Pluto colony (card cycling), Mars University

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game for engine builders. The tile placement gives immediate value, card draw compounds over time.

---

### Standard Technology (#156) — 72/B

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for Science tag + 1 VP (5 MC) + 3 MC rebate per SP. Net cost ~4 MC for the effect. With 3+ SPs the effect generates 9+ MC. Credicor combo: greenery for 16 MC.

**Почему B (72):** Strong with Credicor ('Creditech' archetype), enabling cheap greeneries and cities. icehawk84 notes the science tag is often more relevant than the effect. Solid in any game where you plan to do standard projects, which is most games. Science tag has high value for requirements.

**Синергии:** Credicor, Thorgate, AI Central, Mass Converter, Anti-Gravity Technology

**Когда брать:** When planning to do 3+ standard projects, especially with Credicor. Science tag always useful. Good early-mid game.

---

### Venusian Animals (#259) — 72/B

Стоимость: 15 MC | Требования: 18% Venus | Теги: Venus, Animal, Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC for 1 VP per science tag played after. Venus+Animal+Science triple tag (~7-8 MC). Req Venus 18%. If 3 science tags after: 3 VP (15 MC) + tags. If 5+: amazing.

**Почему B (72):** icehawk84 scored 13 VP on it in one game, calling it one of the best cards when Venus is terraformed early. But Venus 18% is harsh - Krazyguy75 says it takes 6+ gens. The triple tag is excellent. When it works, it's S-tier. Average case: 3-4 VP + great tags. Held back by Venus req unreliability.

**Синергии:** Science engine, Card draw, Olympus Conference, Mars University, Freyja Biodomes

**Когда брать:** When Venus is at/near 18% and you have card draw + science tags to play. Hate-draft against science players if Venus is high.

### WG Project (#P91) — 72/B

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: Chairman | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC for best-of-3 preludes. Average prelude value ~25 MC, best-of-3 ~28 MC. Net gain ~16 MC. Earth tag worth ~2-3 MC. Req Chairman (may cost 5-10 MC in delegates to secure).

**Почему B (72):** Play a prelude mid-game for 12 MC is strong. benbever details the math: best-of-3 makes it much less risky than Board of Directors. SoupsBane says 'probably too cheap for its effect.' Some preludes (Loan, UNMI Contractor, Excentric Sponsor) are amazing mid-game. Chairman requirement adds ~5-10 MC cost but being Chairman is already valuable. Earth tag synergizes well.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Chairman position, Loan prelude, UNMI Contractor prelude

**Когда брать:** When you are or can become Chairman. Gen 2-4 for maximum prelude value. Earth tag bonus. Fun and powerful.

### Atmoscoop (#217) — 72/B

Стоимость: 22 MC | Требования: 3 Science tags | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 22+3=25 MC for 2 TR (14-14.8 MC) + 2 floaters (2-4 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Jovian+Space tags (3-5 MC). Ti-payable. Effective cost with ti ~19-21 MC. Total value ~24-29 MC. Requires 3 Science tags.

**Почему B (72):** Solid package of 2 TR + floaters + VP with premium Jovian+Space tags. Ti-payable via Space tag. The choice between temperature or Venus gives flexibility -- Venus is usually better for VP strategies. 2 floaters to any card fuels floater engines. The 3 Science tag requirement is the main barrier. Comparable to other 2-TR cards but the tag quality and flexibility make it above average. Jovian tag enables milestone/award.

**Синергии:** Dirigibles, Stratospheric Birds, Phobolog, Jovian Embassy, Mass Converter

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ Science tags and need TR + tags. Best gen 3-5. Ti-payable makes it Space engine friendly. Venus raise option preferred for floater strategies.

---

### Colonial Representation (#P71) — 72/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for +1 influence permanent (3-5 MC/gen in Turmoil) + 3 MC per colony on play (6-12 MC if 2-4 colonies). Total value ~15-25 MC depending on colonies and remaining gens. No tags (-3 to -5 MC penalty).

**Почему B (72):** The permanent +1 influence is very strong in Turmoil games -- it affects party bonuses, chairman elections, and delegate effectiveness every generation. The colony rebate on play (3 MC per colony) provides immediate return. With 2-3 colonies this is 6-9 MC back immediately, making effective cost only 4-7 MC for permanent influence. No tags hurts but the Turmoil value compensates. Requires both Colonies and Turmoil expansions to function.

**Синергии:** Poseidon, Aridor, Sky Docks, Turmoil parties, Colony-heavy strategies

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-4 with 2+ colonies in Turmoil games. The earlier the permanent influence, the more value. Skip without Turmoil. Best with colony-heavy corps like Poseidon.

---

### Hermetic Order of Mars (#X56) — 72/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: Max 4% oxygen | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 2 MC-prod (10-12 MC gen 1) + MC per empty adjacent area (~3-6 MC immediate). No tags penalty (-3 to -5 MC). Max 4% O2 req limits to gen 1-2. Total value ~13-18 MC. Net +0 to +5 MC.

**Почему B (72):** Strong early-game economy card. 2 MC-prod for 13 MC is decent rate (6.5 MC/prod), and the immediate MC from empty adjacent areas can add 3-6 MC. The max 4% O2 requirement forces gen 1-2 play which is actually ideal for MC-prod cards -- maximum gens to compound. No tags is the main penalty. The empty area bonus works best when you have tiles placed early in strategic locations. Comparable to Building Industries but without the useful Building tag.

**Синергии:** Manutech, Landlord strategies, Early tile placement, MC-prod engines

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 only when O2 is at 0-4%. Best with early tile placement for adjacency MC. Always skip after gen 2 -- the window is too narrow.

---

### Static Harvesting (#X74) — 72/B

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: Max 3 oceans | Теги: Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 5+3=8 MC for 1 energy-prod (7 MC gen 1) + 1 MC per Building tag (~3-6 MC with 3-6 Building tags). Power tag worth 2-3 MC. Max 3 oceans req. Total value ~12-16 MC. Net +4 to +8 MC.

**Почему B (72):** Cheap card with scaling immediate payoff. Energy production for 8 MC is slightly above average but the MC-per-Building-tag bonus makes it very efficient for Building-heavy players. With 4-5 Building tags it is effectively free energy-prod with 4-5 MC profit. The max 3 oceans requirement limits it to gen 1-3 typically, which is when energy-prod is most valuable. Power tag is useful for milestone/Thermalist synergies. One of the best cheap Power cards.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Mining Guild, Building-heavy strategies, Manutech, Thorgate

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with 3+ Building tags played or planned. Skip after 3 oceans are placed. Best value with steel-heavy Building strategies.

---

### Stratospheric Expedition (#P84) — 72/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Venus, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2 | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for 2 floaters (2-4 MC) + 2 Venus cards drawn free (6-8 MC value) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Venus+Space tags (3-5 MC). Ti-payable. Total value ~16-22 MC. Net +1 to +7 MC.

**Почему B (72):** Triple tag (Venus+Space+Event) with floater placement, free Venus card draw, and VP. The 2 free Venus cards are the standout -- equivalent to saving 6 MC on card buy. Ti-payable via Space tag. The floaters fuel engines like Dirigibles, Stratospheric Birds. Venus+Space tags trigger many synergies. Event tag means no lingering tags but the immediate value is strong. Great for Venus-focused strategies where the free cards find high-value Venus targets.

**Синергии:** Aphrodite, Morning Star Inc, Dirigibles, Stratospheric Birds, Celestic, Venus Orbital Survey

**Когда брать:** When running Venus strategy or need Venus cards. Ti-payable makes it accessible. Best gen 2-5 for maximum Venus card utilization.

---

### Virus (#050) — 72/B

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: Microbe | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 1+3=4 MC for removing up to 2 animals or 5 plants from any player. In 3P: removing 2 animals = denying ~10 VP = huge swing. 5 plants = denying 1 greenery (~7-9 MC). Microbe tag worth 2-3 MC. Total attack value ~7-15 MC for 4 MC cost.

**Почему B (72):** One of the most efficient attack cards at 4 MC total. Removing 2 animals from Birds/Fish/Predators denies ~10 VP which is game-changing in close games. The 5-plant removal can deny a greenery. Microbe tag is useful for Decomposers, Viral Enhancers. However, take-that in 3P always helps the third player, which is the inherent penalty. The flexibility between animals and plants makes it better than most attack cards. In practice, the animal removal is the killer mode -- save it for end-game VP denial.

**Синергии:** Decomposers, Viral Enhancers, GMO Contract, Anti-VP strategies

**Когда брать:** Draft when opponent has animal VP engine (Birds, Fish, Predators). Even without targets, cheap Microbe tag has value. Best held for late-game animal denial.

---

### Asteroid (#009) — 71/B

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 14+3=17 MC for 1 temp TR (7 MC) + 2 ti (6 MC) + remove 3 plants. Net cost ~8 MC for 1 TR. Ti-payable via Space tag. Event tag synergies.

**Почему B (71):** Solid space event. Effective cost after ti cashback is only ~8 MC for 1 temp TR, which is excellent. Ti-payable, event tag enables Media Group, IC, Optimal Aerobraking synergies. Plant removal is a bonus (not core value). Always a reasonable draft pick for terraform-focused strategies. Not flashy but consistently good.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Media Group, Phobolog, Interplanetary Cinematics, Solar Logistics

**Когда брать:** Most games when you have titanium. Higher priority with event/space rebates. Good for controlling temperature track.

---

### Flooding (#188) — 71/B

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 7 MC + 3 MC card = 10 MC cost. Returns: 1 ocean (1 TR ~7.2 MC + placement bonus ~2-4 MC) + optional -4 MC to opponent. Total ~9-11 MC value + attack bonus. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему B (71):** Cheapest unrestricted ocean in the game. Per shai_aus, the -1 VP sucks but is cancelled by the TR. The -4 MC attack is a nice bonus but you'd play it without it. Per icehawk84, one of the better ocean events. At 10 MC for an ocean, it's 8 MC cheaper than SP ocean. The no-tag penalty is offset by the raw efficiency. Great for accelerating the game or enabling plant conversions.

**Синергии:** Arctic Algae, Kelp Farming, lakefront ocean strategy, Legend milestone, Media Group

**Когда брать:** Almost always when you need oceans. Good early for placement bonuses, good late for ending the game.

---

### Gene Repair (#091) — 71/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 3 Science tags | Теги: Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 12 MC + 3 MC card = 15 MC cost. Returns: 2 MC-prod (~10 MC gen1) + 2 VP (~10 MC late) + Science tag (~4 MC). Total ~24 MC. Requires 3 Science tags.

**Почему B (71):** Efficient production + VP bundle for science engines. Per the game's formula, 3 Science tag discount makes this effectively cheaper. At 15 MC for 2 MC-prod + 2 VP + Science tag, it's solid value. The 3 Science tag requirement is easily met by mid-game in science engines. Late-game play still yields 2 VP for 15 MC minus whatever MC-prod returns. A reliable mid-game play for engine builders.

**Синергии:** Science engine, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Scientist award, Banker award

**Когда брать:** Gen 3-6 with 3+ science tags. Good bundle of economy and VP for science players.

---

### Luna Metropolis (#236) — 71/B

Стоимость: 21 MC | Теги: City, Space, Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 21 MC + 3 MC card = 24 MC for N MC-prod (per Earth tag including this) + city on reserved area + 2 VP. With 4 Earth tags: 4 MC-prod (~20 MC) + city (~2 VP) + 2 VP. Ti-payable. City+Space+Earth triple tags.

**Почему B (71):** The 'third Cartel' - excellent with Earth tag heavy strategies. With 4+ Earth tags it provides massive MC production plus a city and VP. Ti-payable via Space tag. Triple tag (City, Space, Earth) is extremely versatile. No requirements. The city on reserved area doesn't score greenery adjacency but contributes to Mayor milestone. Best with Point Luna, Teractor, or Earth Office.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Cartel, Miranda Resort

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ Earth tags or are building Earth tag strategy. Excellent titanium dump. Good for Banker/Mayor.

---

### Natural Preserve (#044) — 71/B

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: Max 4% oxygen | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 9+3=12 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 VP (5) + 1 MC-prod (5-6) + Science+Building tags (4-7) + tile placement (teleport, 2-4 bonus). Total ~16-22 MC. Net +4-10.

**Почему B (71):** Underrated card with excellent tags (Science+Building), a tile for teleporting, VP, and some MC production. Max 4% O2 limits it to early game but that's when you want production anyway. icehawk84 rates it often a high priority. The tile placement on Elysium can grab the 3-card spot. Steel payable is nice.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Builder milestone, Scientist award, Mars University, Elysium 3-card spot

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when O2 is low. Excellent early for science tag, tile placement, and production. Dead card after 4% O2.

---

### Ceres Tech Market (#P68) — 71/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Science, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2 | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for Science+Space tags (4-6 MC) + colony rebate (2 MC per colony on play) + card discard action (2 MC per discarded card) + 1 VP (5 MC). Total value ~15-20 MC. Net +0 to +5 MC plus ongoing action.

**Почему B (71):** Strong utility card with premium Science+Space tags. The card discard action provides flexibility to convert dead cards into cash (2 MC each). Colony rebate on play gives immediate return with colonies. The action is better than it looks -- in late game, converting 3-4 dead cards to 6-8 MC per gen is solid. Science tag enables AI Central, Olympus Conference. Space tag for ti-payment. 1 VP rounds it out. Best in longer games where card recycling matters.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Colony strategies, Card-draw engines

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-4 with Science tag synergies and/or colonies. The card recycling action is useful throughout the game. Science+Space tag combo is always valuable.

---

### Luna Governor (#C20) — 71/B

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: 3 Earth tags | Теги: Earth, Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for 2 MC-prod (10-12 MC gen 1) + 2 Earth tags (4-6 MC synergy value). Requires 3 Earth tags. Total value ~14-18 MC. Net +7-11 MC. 3.5 MC/prod effective.

**Почему B (71):** Extremely efficient MC-production card. 2 MC-prod for 7 MC = 3.5 MC/prod which is the best rate in the game. The double Earth tag is premium -- enables Point Luna, Cartel, Luna Metropolis, Earth Office discounts. The 3 Earth tag requirement is achievable in all-expansion games with Earth-rich card pool. With Point Luna this is effectively free (draw 2 cards = 6 MC value). One of the best economy cards for Earth engine players.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Cartel, Luna Metropolis, Sponsoring Nation

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with 2+ Earth tags already played and Point Luna/Teractor/Earth Office. The earlier the better for MC-prod compounding. Essential for Earth engine.

---

### Business Contacts (#111) — 70/B

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for 2 chosen cards (6-8 MC, seeing 4 = better selection). Earth tag (2-3 MC). Net ~8-11 MC value. Event synergies.

**Почему B (70):** Look at 4 cards, keep 2 for 10 MC. The selection quality (seeing 4 to keep 2) is better than blind draw. Earth tag and event tag add synergy value with Point Luna, Media Group, IC. Slightly expensive for card draw (5 MC/card effective) but the selection premium makes it worthwhile. Good gen 1-4 for finding key engine pieces. One of the better Earth-tagged card draw options.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Media Group, IC, Earth Office, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-4 when searching for specific engine pieces. Good with Earth tag synergies and event cashbacks.

---

### Development Center (#014) — 70/B

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 11 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 14 MC cost. Action: spend 1 energy for 1 card (~3-4 MC value). Need ~5 uses to break even. Science+Building tags (~5 MC).

**Почему B (70):** Good card draw engine but requires energy production investment. Per icehawk84, not nearly as strong as AI Central but much easier to deploy. The energy requirement can be surprisingly difficult per shai_aus. The Science+Building tags are excellent. Per ad_hocNC, the energy restriction makes it less flexible than Restricted Area, but still a high draft pick for engine builders.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Mass Converter, Quantum Extractor, Mars University, Valley Trust

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when you have or can cheaply get energy production. Core card draw for engine strategies.

---

### GHG Producing Bacteria (#034) — 70/B

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 4% oxygen | Теги: Science, Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 8 MC + 3 MC card = 11 MC cost. Action: add 1 microbe or spend 2 microbes for temp raise. With Extreme-Cold Fungus/Symbiotic Fungus: 1 TR per gen. Solo: ~3-4 TR over game = 21-28 MC.

**Почему B (70):** One of the better microbe terraforming cards. The 4% oxygen requirement is light. At 11 MC cost, getting 2 temp raises (~14.4 MC) over the game breaks even. With microbe feeders (Extreme-Cold Fungus, Symbiotic Fungus, Enceladus colony), it can generate 3-4+ TR which is excellent. The Microbe+Science tags trigger Decomposers and Mars University. Better than Thermophiles and Regolith Eaters due to easier requirement.

**Синергии:** Extreme-Cold Fungus, Symbiotic Fungus, Enceladus colony, Decomposers, Splice

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when temperature still has room and you have or expect microbe feeders.

---

### Heavy Taxation (#C14) — 70/B

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: 2 Earth tags | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 3 MC + 3 MC card - 1 VP penalty = ~11 MC effective cost. Gain 2 MC-prod (~10-12 MC) + 4 MC immediate = ~14-16 MC value. Breaks even in 1 gen! Requires 2 Earth tags.

**Почему B (70):** Extremely efficient production card that literally breaks even in one generation. The -1 VP is easily offset by the tempo advantage. Earth tag requirement is manageable with preludes and corps. The Earth tag itself adds synergy value. One of the best cheap economy cards when requirements are met.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Cartel, IC

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game when you have 2+ Earth tags. Great gen 1-4 play. Skip if fewer than 4 gens remaining.

---

### Ishtar Expedition (#P76) — 70/B

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 10% Venus | Теги: Venus | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 6 MC + 3 MC card = 9 MC for 3 titanium (~9 MC) + 2 Venus cards (~6 MC curated draws). Requires Venus 10%. Ti alone pays for the card. Venus tag.

**Почему B (70):** Self-funding card that breaks even on titanium alone and gets 2 free Venus cards as bonus. The Venus 10% requirement is manageable with WGT bumping Venus. In games where Venus is actively being terraformed, this is excellent. The 2 curated Venus cards can find strong plays. Slightly overpowered compared to similar cards per icehawk84.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Venus strategy cards, Morning Star Inc

**Когда брать:** When Venus has been raised or is actively being raised. The titanium pays for itself; the Venus cards are pure upside.

---

### Jovian Embassy (#X23) — 70/B

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: Jovian, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 14 MC + 3 MC card = 17 MC for 1 TR (~7 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Jovian tag (~3-5 MC) + Building tag (steel payable). Total: ~15-17 MC value at minimum, plus Jovian multiplier potential.

**Почему B (70):** Efficient Jovian tag that doubles as a last-gen steel dump. The TR + VP + Jovian tag provide solid base value, and with any Jovian multipliers the Jovian tag becomes very valuable. Building tag means steel payment which is excellent. Compare to Colonizer Training Camp (70/B) - similar role as cheap Jovian VP source but more flexible with TR and steel payment.

**Синергии:** Terraforming Ganymede, Io Mining Industries, Saturn Systems, Rim Settler milestone

**Когда брать:** Last gen or late game as steel dump with Jovian multiplier upside. Good for Rim Settler milestone on Hellas.

---

### Martian Zoo (#C24) — 70/B

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 2 cities | Теги: Animal, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 12+3=15 MC. Value: 1 VP (5) + Animal+Building tags (3) + action ~2 MC/Earth tag played. With 4-5 Earth tags post-play = 8-10 MC from action.

**Почему B (70):** Strong when played early with many Earth tags incoming. The 2-city requirement can delay it significantly in 3P. Animal+Building is a great tag combo for Ecologist/Diversifier. With Meat Industry combo it becomes powerful. But inconsistent -- sometimes cities don't appear until mid-game.

**Синергии:** Meat Industry, Miranda colony, Tharsis Republic, Point Luna, Viral Enhancers

**Когда брать:** When 2 cities exist and you plan to play Earth tags. Best with city preludes or Tharsis in game.

---

### Mining Quota (#239) — 70/B

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 1 Venus tag / 1 Earth tag / 1 Jovian tag | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** Cost 5+3=8 MC (steel payable). Value: 2 steel-prod (16 MC gen 1) + Building tag (1-2). Total ~17-18 MC. Net +9-10 MC gen 1. But req: Venus+Earth+Jovian tags.

**Почему B (70):** Incredible value IF requirements are met -- 2 steel production for 8 MC is absurd efficiency. The triple planetary tag requirement (Venus+Earth+Jovian) is the real challenge. With preludes and wild tags it's occasionally achievable gen 1. icehawk84 calls it insane value when played early. FieldMouse007 notes sometimes you pass because unlocking requirements is too costly.

**Синергии:** Advanced Alloys, Rego Plastics, Wild tag preludes, Colonizer Training Camp, Space Elevator

**Когда брать:** When you naturally have or can cheaply get all three planetary tags. Don't bend your strategy to meet the req.

---

### Rim Freighters (#C35) — 70/B

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 7 MC total (4+3) for -1 trade cost (~7.5 MC/gen savings, equivalent to 1 energy prod). Space tag worth 1-2 MC. Effectively saves 1 energy production permanently.

**Почему B (70):** Cheap and effective trade cost reduction. Saves 1 energy or titanium per trade, which compounds quickly. benbever values it highly. Space tag at 4 MC is great for Satellites/milestones. Only good when actively trading (worthless without colonies). SonicN confirms '90% of the time this is 1 power production.'

**Синергии:** Colony strategies, Multiple trade fleets, Space tag synergies, Cryo Sleep

**Когда брать:** Early game when colonies are in play and you plan to trade regularly. Cheap, effective, simple.

---

### Sister Planet Support (#244) — 70/B

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: 1 Venus tag / 1 Earth tag | Теги: Venus, Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 10 MC total (7+3) for 3 MC-prod (~15-18 MC) + Venus+Earth tags (~5 MC). Req: 1 Venus + 1 Earth tag. Total value ~20-23 MC. Very efficient if played early.

**Почему B (70):** 3 MC-prod for 10 MC is better than Acquired Company. Venus+Earth tags add synergy value for Cartel, Miranda Resort, Unity party. Requirement is manageable but not trivial - you need Venus+Earth tags already. icehawk84 rates it B-tier. Krazyguy75 argues Venus tags are hard to find, limiting reliability.

**Синергии:** Earth tag engines (Cartel, Miranda Resort), Unity party, Specialist milestone, Venus tag synergies

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when you already have Venus+Earth tags. Loses value quickly after gen 3.

---

### Space Elevator (#013) — 70/B

Стоимость: 27 MC | Теги: Space, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 30 MC total (27+3) for 1 ti-prod (~12.5 MC) + action: spend steel for 5 MC (~3 MC profit/use) + 2 VP (~10 MC) + Space+Building tags (~3 MC). Total value with 4 uses: ~37 MC.

**Почему B (70):** Expensive but rewarding with steel production. Ti production + steel->MC conversion + 2 VP makes it a decent mid-game investment. shai_aus is uncertain about value. COTD consensus: 'good with steel corps, mediocre otherwise.' IC with its 20 steel opening loves this card. Steel payable. Needs 4+ action uses to fully pay off.

**Синергии:** IC (steel pile), Mining Guild, Steel production preludes, Ceres colony

**Когда брать:** When you have steady steel production (2+ steel-prod). Best for IC opening hand.

---

### Technology Demonstration (#204) — 70/B

Стоимость: 5 MC | Теги: Science, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 5+3=8 MC for 2 cards (6-8 MC) + Science+Space+Event tags. With ti payment: ~5 MC net. With IC: 2 MC rebate. With space discounts: can be very cheap. Science tag triggers Olympus Conf/Mars U.

**Почему B (70):** Mediocre standalone but becomes excellent with synergies. Triple tag value (Science, Space, Event) makes it work with IC, Point Luna, Mars University, Olympus Conference. shai_aus confirms 'consistently good pick' especially with discounts. The tags do more than the cards most of the time.

**Синергии:** IC, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Media Group, Optimal Aerobraking

**Когда брать:** When you have space/event rebates or science tag triggers. Good engine card. Even without synergies, 8 MC for 2 cards is acceptable.

---

### Wildlife Dome (#T15) — 70/B

Стоимость: 15 MC | Требования: Greens ruling | Теги: Animal, Plant, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC (steel-payable) for greenery (TR + VP, worth ~19 MC) + Animal+Plant+Building triple tag (~5-7 MC). Req Greens ruling or 2 delegates. Gen 1 with Greens: 18-4 MC Green bonus =14 MC effective.

**Почему B (70):** benbever gives detailed analysis: greenery worth ~19 MC, triple tag (Animal+Plant+Building) is exceptional value. Gen 1 with Greens ruling gives 4 MC back from policy. Steel-payable makes it cheap. warpspeed100 highlights the rare early animal tag. Great for Ecologist, Gardener, Builder milestones. The Turmoil requirement adds variance but gen 1 Greens is common.

**Синергии:** Decomposers, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, Aridor, Ecologist milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 when Greens are ruling (4 MC back). Mid-game with 2 delegates in Greens. Triple tag always valuable.

---

### Colonizer Training Camp (#001) — 70/B

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: Max 5% oxygen | Теги: Jovian, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for 2 VP (10 MC) + Jovian+Building tags (3-5 MC). Steel-payable via Building. Max 5% O2 req = gen 1-3. Effective cost with 2 steel = ~7 MC. Net +2 to +4 MC.

**Почему B (70):** Cheap VP card with premium Jovian tag. 2 VP for ~7 MC (with steel) is excellent rate. The Jovian tag enables milestone (Hoverlord), award, and Jovian synergy cards. Building tag provides steel payability. The max 5% O2 requirement is fine for gen 1-2 play which is when you want cheap VP dumps. Steel dump priority in opening hands. Comparable to Research but with better tags and VP.

**Синергии:** Jovian Embassy, Jupiter Floating Station, Io Mining Industries, Interplanetary Colony Ship, Steel production

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 as cheap VP + Jovian tag. Steel dump priority. Skip after gen 3 when O2 rises above 5%. Always pick with Jovian synergies.

---

### Noctis Farming (#176) — 70/B

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: -20°C | Теги: Plant, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 1 MC-prod (5-6 MC gen 1) + 2 plants (1.6 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Plant+Building tags (3-4 MC). Steel-payable. -20C req. Total value ~15-17 MC. Net +2 to +4 MC.

**Почему B (70):** Solid utility card with good tag combination. Plant+Building is the NRA (Nitrogen Rich Asteroid) enabler duo. 1 MC-prod + 2 plants + 1 VP is a nice triple benefit. Steel-payable via Building tag. The -20C requirement is mild -- met from gen 2 onward typically. The main value is as NRA enabler and cheap VP dump with steel. Not exciting but reliably good. Comparable to Farming but cheaper and with Building tag.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Insects, Mining Guild, Ecological Zone, Steel production

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 as NRA enabler + steel dump + VP. Best with Plant tag synergies. Skip after gen 4 when MC-prod has too few gens to compound.

### Cartel (#137) — 69/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for N MC-prod where N = Earth tags (including this). With 3 Earth tags: 3 MC-prod (15 MC). With 4: 4 MC-prod (20 MC). Earth tag (2-3 MC).

**Почему C (69):** Scaling MC-prod based on Earth tags. With 3+ Earth tags it is good value (5 MC or less per MC-prod). The Earth tag itself is valuable. With Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office the card gets excellent. However, with 1-2 Earth tags, 11 MC for 1-2 MC-prod is poor. Requires some Earth tag investment to be worthwhile. In all-expansion games, Earth tags are more common.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Luna Metropolis, Acquired Company

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ other Earth tags. Excellent with Point Luna + Earth Office. Skip with only 1 Earth tag.

---

### Bushes (#093) — 68/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: -10°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 2 plant-prod (16 MC) + 2 plants (4 MC) + Plant tag (1-2 MC). Total ~21 MC. 5 MC/plant-prod. Excellent rate.

**Почему C (68):** Very similar to Algae but with a -10C temperature requirement instead of 5 oceans. Same cost, 1 more plant but no initial plant gain from Algae. The -10C requirement is usually met gen 3-5 in 3P/WGT. 2 plant-prod for 13 MC is strong. Slightly worse than Algae because temperature is controlled less predictably than oceans, but still a top-tier plant card when the requirement is met.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Insects, Ecoline, Robot Pollinators, Arctic Algae

**Когда брать:** When -10C will be met in 1-2 gens and you want greeneries. Similar priority to Algae.

---

### Business Network (#110) — 68/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC + 1 MC-prod (-5 MC) = 12 MC effective. Action: look at top card, buy for 3 or discard. ~1.5-2 MC/gen average value. Earth tag (2-3 MC).

**Почему C (68):** Cheap Earth tag with an ongoing card selection action. The -1 MC-prod is a significant cost. The action itself is low value -- you see 1 card and either buy it for 3 MC or skip. The value depends on how well your economy can absorb buying extra cards. Better in engine games with strong economy. The Earth tag is the main draw for Point Luna players. Comparable to Interplanetary Trade as an ongoing economy effect.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Earth Office, Teractor, Engine strategies

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with Earth tag synergy and good economy. Skip if MC-prod is tight.

---

### Cyberia Systems (#X53) — 68/C

Стоимость: 16 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 16 MC + 3 MC card = 19 MC (steel payable). Returns: 1 steel-prod (~8 MC) + copy of 2 building card production boxes. Potential value 25-50+ MC depending on targets. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему C (68):** High ceiling, variable floor. Needs 2 good building card targets with production boxes to shine, which is hard to guarantee. Per benbever, usually yields 4-5 total production for 19 MC which is good, but requires setup. No tags is a real penalty. Per icehawk84, needs premium targets like Cheung Shing Mars or Mining Operations to justify the cost.

**Синергии:** Cheung Shing Mars, Nirgal Enterprises, Sagitta, Community Services, Mining Operations

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with 2+ good building card targets already played. Much better with extended start rule from Prelude 2.

---

### Domed Crater (#016) — 68/C

Стоимость: 24 MC | Требования: Max 7% oxygen | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 24 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~34 MC cost. Returns: 3 MC-prod (~15 MC gen1), 1 VP (~5 MC), 3 plants (~6 MC), city tile (~10-16 MC), City+Building tags (~3 MC). Total ~39-45 MC.

**Почему C (68):** One of the better base game city cards thanks to the 3 plants, which can enable an immediate greenery conversion. Per shai_aus, it's probably the second-best city in base game after Research Outpost. Per icehawk84, the 3 plants are the key. However, the max 7% oxygen requirement limits timing, and the effective cost is high. Per FieldMouse007, the O2 requirement holds it back significantly.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Tharsis Republic, Ecoline, Immigrant City, Pets

**Когда брать:** Mid game with steel and 5+ plant resources for immediate greenery conversion. Less good played early purely for economy.

---

### Freyja Biodomes (#227) — 68/C

Стоимость: 14 MC | Требования: 10% Venus | Теги: Plant, Venus | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 14 MC + 3 MC card = 17 MC cost. Requires 5 Venus tags. Returns: 2 MC-prod (~10 MC gen1), 2 animals or microbes to another card (~10 MC with good target), Venus tag. Total ~20+ MC.

**Почему C (68):** Strong card locked behind a demanding 5 Venus tag requirement. The 2 resources to another card are very good with 1-VP animals (Fish, Birds etc.) or GHG Producing Bacteria. Per COTD consensus, it's good value when playable but 5 Venus tags is very restrictive. In practice, you need Morning Star Inc or a heavy Venus commitment. The 2 MC-prod is usually only worth 1-2 gens of income given the late timing.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Venusian Animals, Stratospheric Birds, Fish, Decomposers

**Когда брать:** Only with 5+ Venus tags or Morning Star Inc at -2 req. Good payoff card for deep Venus strategies.

---

### Invention Contest (#192) — 68/C

Стоимость: 2 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 2 MC + 3 MC card = 5 MC for 1 curated card (look at 3, keep 1). Card value ~3-4 MC, but curated selection worth more. Science tag ~3-5 MC. Event tag.

**Почему C (68):** Cheap science tag with minor card advantage. The curated draw is better than random but you're still paying 5 MC for 1 card which is slightly above card cost. The Science tag is the main draw, enabling science payoffs. With discounts and event rebates it becomes very efficient. Good skill-expression card for experts.

**Синергии:** Mars University, IC, Media Group, Science tag payoffs

**Когда брать:** When you need science tags or card filtering. Better with event rebates. Not high draft priority but solid filler.

---

### Io Mining Industries (#092) — 68/C

Стоимость: 41 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1/Jovian tag

**Экономика:** 41 MC + 3 MC card = 44 MC for 2 ti-prod (~25 MC) + 2 MC-prod (~10 MC) + Jovian tag (3-5 MC) + 1VP/Jovian multiplier. At 44 MC: production ~35 MC = deficit paid by VP potential. Ti-payable helps a lot.

**Почему C (68):** Massive investment that commits you to a Jovian/space strategy. The 44 MC cost is nearly a full generation's income. Production is decent at 34 MC but takes 4+ gens to pay back. The Jovian multiplier VP can be very valuable (3-8+ VP) but requires accumulating more Jovian tags while opponents hate-draft them. Best gen 1 with Phobolog or prelude support. In 3P, opponents will hate-draft Jovians.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Saturn Systems, Advanced Alloys, Terraforming Ganymede, Excentric Sponsor

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 with Phobolog or heavy titanium prelude support. Otherwise too expensive and too slow for 8-gen games.

---

### Jovian Lanterns (#C18) — 68/C

Стоимость: 20 MC | Требования: 1 Jovian tag | Теги: Jovian | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 20 MC + 3 MC card = 23 MC (cash only). 1 TR (~7 MC) + 2 floaters = 1 VP + Jovian tag (~3-5 MC). Action: 1 ti for 2 floaters (1 VP). Starting value: ~15-17 MC. Deficit of 6-8 MC paid by VP accumulation.

**Почему C (68):** Upgraded Security Fleet with better start but expensive and cash-only. The 1 TR and 2 initial floaters give a head start that Security Fleet lacks. The Jovian tag is valuable for multipliers. VP per titanium (3 MC per VP) is good late game. However, 23 MC cash-only is painful, and it has no Space tag. With Titan colony and floater synergies it can be excellent.

**Синергии:** Titan colony, Aerial Mappers, Celestic, Jovian multipliers, Floating Habs

**Когда брать:** Mid game with Jovian/floater synergies. Good Titan colony target. Don't play without floater support.

---

### Lagrange Observatory (#196) — 68/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Science, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 9 MC + 3 MC card = 12 MC for 1 card (~3 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Science+Space tags (~6 MC). Total: ~14 MC value. Ti-payable.

**Почему C (68):** Solid multi-purpose card that works at any point in the game. Early: Science tag for engine building. Mid: card draw for flexibility. Late: VP + Space tag for titanium dump. Never amazing but always useful. Ti-payable makes it efficient. Science + Space tags are a great combination for engine players. Slightly above average but not exciting.

**Синергии:** Mars University, Science engine payoffs, Phobolog, Warp Drive

**Когда брать:** When building science engine or need a VP + science tag. Good titanium dump anytime. Solid 3rd-4th pick in draft.

---

### Mine (#056) — 68/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** Cost 4+3=7 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 steel-prod (8 MC) + Building tag (1-2). Total ~9-10 MC. Net +2-3 MC gen 1.

**Почему C (68):** Simple, solid production card. 7 MC for 1 steel production is good value early. Building tag helps with Builder milestone. icehawk84 rates it a keep in opening hand and high priority gen 1-2. It becomes useless mid-game though. Not exciting but reliably decent when played early.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Advanced Alloys, Rego Plastics, Space Elevator, Electro Catapult

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when you have steel targets. Cheap building tag filler. Skip after gen 3.

---

### Orbital Cleanup (#X08) — 68/C

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 2

**Экономика:** Cost 14+3=17 MC (ti payable) + 2 MC-prod lost (10). Value: 2 VP (10) + Earth+Space tags (3-5) + action: gain MC = science tags. At 4 science tags = 4 MC/gen. Total ~23-31 MC over game.

**Почему C (68):** Good science payoff card. With 4+ science tags the action generates meaningful MC, offsetting the -2 MC-prod. The 2 VP is nice. Earth+Space tags enable discounts and ti payment. The -2 MC-prod makes it bad early unless you have strong science engine incoming. No COTD data from key commenters but community rates it as good mid-game science payoff.

**Синергии:** Science-heavy strategies, Mass Converter, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Point Luna

**Когда брать:** Mid-game with 4+ science tags. The -2 MC-prod means you want it only when the action outweighs the loss.

---

### Potatoes (#X28) — 68/C

Стоимость: 2 MC | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 2+3=5 MC - 2 plants (~4). Value: 2 MC-prod (10-12) + Plant tag (1-2). Total ~11-14 MC. Net ~+2-5 MC.

**Почему C (68):** Extremely cheap plant tag with decent MC production. The cheapest non-prelude plant tag in the game, which shai_aus (27 upvotes) highlights as the key selling point. Losing 2 plants is minor. 2 MC-prod for effective 5-9 MC cost is great early game. Excellent for NRA/Insects enablement. Simple but effective.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid, Insects, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, NRA

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when you have 2 plants or can get them easily. The plant tag is the main value. Great cheap production.

---

### Project Inspection (#X02) — 68/C

Стоимость: 0 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 3 MC total (0+3) for a repeated action. Typical action worth 5 MC, so ~2 MC profit. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему C (68):** Very cheap card that duplicates a blue card action. Average gain is ~5 MC per COTD consensus. No tags is a real downside. Best with high-value actions like AI Central, Martian Rails, Electro Catapult, or 1-VP animals. Low floor but decent ceiling.

**Синергии:** AI Central, Electro Catapult, Martian Rails, Martian Zoo, 1-VP animal cards

**Когда брать:** When you have at least one strong action card. Low priority in draft but almost always playable.

---

### Quantum Extractor (#079) — 68/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: 4 Science tags | Теги: Science, Power | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 16 MC total (13+3) for 4 energy prod (~30 MC) + 2 MC space discount/card + Science+Power tags. Req: 4 Science tags. Value is high but locked behind steep requirement.

**Почему C (68):** Strong energy production and space discount, but 4 Science tag requirement means mid-late game play when energy prod is less critical. icehawk84 calls it 'Mass Converter's little brother.' No VP hurts late game value. FieldMouse007 notes it is 'situational.' Good in science engines but not a priority to force.

**Синергии:** Mass Converter, AI Central, Science engine, Physics Complex, Colonies (trading energy)

**Когда брать:** When already building science engine and need energy. Do not play bad science tags just to unlock this.

---

### Saturn Surfing (#X11) — 68/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Jovian, Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 16 MC total (13+3) for Jovian+Earth tags (~6 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + X floaters (1 per Earth tag) + action: remove floater for X MC. With 3+ Earth tags, action generates 3+ MC/gen.

**Почему C (68):** Good package of Jovian + Earth tags and VP. The floater action generates meaningful MC with enough Earth tags. Can enable Hoverlord milestone surprise. But expensive without Earth tags already in play. COTD is mixed - some see it as strong, others as mediocre. Tags alone justify much of the cost.

**Синергии:** Earth tag engines, Point Luna, Teractor, Hoverlord milestone, Floater support cards

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ Earth tags and value the Jovian tag. Late game if Hoverlord is contestable.

---

### Solar Wind Power (#077) — 68/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Science, Space, Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 14 MC total (11+3) - 6 MC (2 titanium) = effective 8 MC for 1 energy prod (~7.5 MC) + Science+Space+Power triple tag (~7-10 MC). Excellent tag density.

**Почему C (68):** Great triple-tag card with no requirements. Effective cost of ~8 MC for energy production plus three valuable tags is strong. Science tag without requirements is particularly useful. The titanium refund makes the energy production very affordable. Community consensus is positive - 'awesome for Aridor' and solid utility card.

**Синергии:** Aridor (3 new tags), Science/Space/Power milestones, Diversifier, Colonies (energy for trading)

**Когда брать:** Early game when you need energy production and tags. Good value for science engine starts.

---

### Sponsored Academies (#247) — 68/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Earth, Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12 MC total (9+3) for net +2 cards (draw 3, discard 1) + 1 VP + Earth+Science tags (~6 MC) - opponents draw 1 each. In 3P: you gain 2 cards, opponents gain 2 cards total.

**Почему C (68):** The card draw is decent but giving opponents free cards in 3P is a real cost. Earth+Science tags are valuable. 1 VP adds floor. icehawk84 says 'not a slam dunk without synergies.' FieldMouse007 calls it 'situational.' Best when triggering Mars U/Olympus Conference. Play after opponents have passed to minimize their benefit from the free draw.

**Синергии:** Mars University, Olympus Conference, Earth Office, Science engine, AGT unlock

**Когда брать:** When you have science triggers in play. Play after opponents pass. Good Science+Earth tag source.

---

### Strip Mine (#138) — 68/C

Стоимость: 25 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 25+3=28 MC, minus 2 energy-prod (14 MC) = effective cost 42 MC. Gains: 2 steel-prod (16 MC) + 1 ti-prod (12.5 MC) + 2 O2 (14 MC) + Building tag. Total value ~44 MC gen 1. Steel-payable.

**Почему C (68):** Powerful production card but only when played gen 1 with preludes/cards providing energy. benbever warns it's overrated - only very good gen 1 without needing SP energy. IC loves it as a steel sink. With colonies, energy is more valuable, making the -2 energy cost worse. Solid in the right scenario, bad otherwise.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Thorgate, Power Generation prelude, Mining Guild, Robotic Workforce

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 only when you already have 2+ energy production from preludes/corp. Skip if you'd need SP power plant.

---

### Zeppelins (#129) — 68/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: 5% oxygen | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC for N MC-prod (where N = cities on Mars) + 1 VP (5 MC). No tags penalty (-3 to -5). In 3P with 4 cities: 4 MC-prod (20 MC) + VP. Great Banker swing.

**Почему C (68):** Zeppelins is the premier Banker award swing card. benbever frequently compares it to Toll Station. In 3P mid-late game with 3-5 cities on Mars, the MC-prod can be 3-5. The 1 VP helps. No tags is a real penalty though. Req 5% O2 limits early play. Primarily a Banker/milestone card.

**Синергии:** Banker award, Tharsis Republic, City-heavy boards, Zeppelin card draw, Late game MC dump

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game when cities are accumulating. Key Banker award swing. Less useful if Banker isn't in play.

---

### Productive Outpost (#C30) — 68/C

Стоимость: 0 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 0+3=3 MC for all colony bonuses repeated. Value depends on colonies owned: 2 colonies = ~8-16 MC, 3 colonies = ~12-24 MC. Net +5 to +21 MC depending on colony count and colony types. No tags (-3 to -5 MC penalty).

**Почему C (68):** Zero cost makes this always playable, but value depends entirely on colony count. With 2+ colonies on good locations (Titan, Ganymede, Luna) the free bonus trigger is worth 8-16 MC for 3 MC cost, which is excellent. With 0-1 colonies it is nearly worthless. No tags means no synergy value. The variance in value depending on game state puts it squarely in C-tier -- sometimes great, sometimes trash. Best as a late-game burst card when you have 3+ colonies.

**Синергии:** Poseidon, Aridor, Colony-heavy strategies, Titan colony, Ganymede colony

**Когда брать:** Only with 2+ colonies on valuable locations. Best as a burst card gen 5-7. Skip with 0-1 colonies. No-tag penalty limits ceiling.

---

### Rover Construction (#038) — 68/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for +2 MC per any city placed (all players) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Building tag (steel-payable). In 3P expect 5-8 cities total = 10-16 MC. Net +4-10 MC. Steel-payable drops cost to ~7-8 MC.

**Почему C (68):** Passive economy engine triggered by any player placing cities. In 3P games with 5-8 total cities, this generates 10-16 MC over the game. Steel-payable via Building tag. 1 VP is a nice bonus. Best played gen 1-2 to maximize triggers. The variance depends on how many cities are placed -- in city-light games it underperforms. Not as flashy as active action cards but consistent and cheap. Building tag is always useful.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, City-placing strategies, Immigration Shuttles, Capital, Steel production

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 as passive income engine. Steel dump priority. Better in city-heavy metas. Skip gen 4+ when fewer cities remain to be placed.

---

### Asteroid Mining Consortium (#002) — 67/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: Production | Теги: Jovian | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC for 1 ti-prod net (12.5 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Jovian tag (3-5 MC). Value ~20-22 MC. Take-that in 3P: -5 penalty. Net ~15-17 MC.

**Почему C (67):** Strong in 2P but significantly weakened in 3P due to take-that pattern -- stealing ti-prod from one player benefits the third player free. The Jovian tag and VP are valuable, and 16 MC for net ti-prod + VP + Jovian is decent. However, the requirement (you need ti-prod) limits when you can play it. In 3P, the take-that penalty drops it from B to C tier. Devastating early against Phobolog/Saturn Systems.

**Синергии:** Phobolog (as attacker), Jovian multipliers, Saturn Systems, Rim Settler milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when you have ti-prod and can target a key opponent. Late game for Jovian tag. Counter-draft to protect your ti-prod.

---

### Dirigibles (#222) — 67/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC cost. Action: 1 floater to ANY card + floaters worth 3 MC for Venus cards. Equivalent to ~3 MC-prod for Venus spending = ~15 MC over 5 gens. Venus tag for Venuphile.

**Почему C (67):** The best floater dispenser for Venus strategies. The 'to ANY card' clause is key — floaters can go to Aerial Mappers (half a card), Deuterium Export (energy prod), or VP cards. Per benbever, equivalent to ~3 MC-prod but restricted to Venus cards when used on itself. The Venus tag helps with Venuphile and Hoverlord. Decent but not amazing unless you have strong floater targets.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Celestic, Aerial Mappers, Floating Habs, Titan colony

**Когда брать:** When committing to Venus strategy with other floater/Venus cards. Good for Hoverlord milestone.

---

### Giant Solar Shade (#229) — 67/C

Стоимость: 27 MC | Теги: Space, Venus | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 27 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card = 30 MC cost. Returns: 3 Venus TR (~21.6 MC over game). Space+Venus tags (~4 MC). Total ~25.6 MC. Value improves if played early for income.

**Почему C (67):** The most direct way to raise Venus 3 steps. At 30 MC for 3 Venus TR, it's 10 MC per TR which is acceptable but not great. Ti payability helps significantly. Per benbever's analysis, in an 8-gen game starting gen 1: 3 VP + 21 MC income = net cost only 9 MC. Per Krazyguy75, Venus steps are overvalued by the game. Best when Venus synergies exist (Aphrodite +3 MC/raise, Terraforming Deal, Venus requirements).

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Aphrodite, Terraforming Deal, Venus requirement cards, Venuphile award

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with titanium and Venus synergies. Less good late game when TR income is minimal.

---

### Investment Loan (#151) — 67/C

Стоимость: 3 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 3 MC + 3 MC card = 6 MC cost. Gain 10 MC. -1 MC prod (~5 MC gen 1). Net: +4 MC immediate minus ongoing production loss. Earth tag. Event tag.

**Почему C (67):** Strong tempo card when you have something urgent to spend the 10 MC on. The -1 MC-prod is a real cost but in 8-gen games with WGT, it's often worth the immediate cash injection. Earth tag provides synergy with Teractor, Point Luna, etc. With event rebates the deal improves significantly. Gets passed too often in draft according to experienced players.

**Синергии:** Teractor, Earth Office, IC, Media Group, Point Luna

**Когда брать:** When you need 10 MC now to play a key card a generation earlier. Better mid-late game when -1 MC-prod matters less. Great with event rebates.

---

### Mining Rights (#067) — 67/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 9+3=12 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 steel/ti-prod (8-12.5) + placement bonus (2-5) + Building tag (1-2). Total ~11-20 MC. Net -1 to +8 MC.

**Почему C (67):** Similar to Mining Area but doesn't require adjacency to your own tile -- just placement on a mineral spot. This gives flexibility and 'teleportation' value for spreading across the map. On titanium spots it's good value. shai_aus rates it great for Mining Guild, ok for others. The 5 MC premium over Mining Area is the teleport flexibility.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Mining Area, Phobolog, Landlord award, Tharsis map steel/ti spots

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 on a titanium spot. Decent for teleporting across the map. Less valuable after gen 3.

---

### Titan Shuttles (#C45) — 67/C

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 23+3=26 MC for Jovian+Space tags + 1 VP + action: add 2 floaters to any Jovian or convert floaters to titanium. Effectively ~1-2 ti-prod over time. With floater support: much more.

**Почему C (67):** Complex card. On its own, it's roughly 1 ti-prod on average (cash out every other gen) for 26 MC, which is poor. But the floater flexibility is real: feed other Jovian floater cards, claim Hoverlord, or bank large ti dumps for Unity gens. icehawk84 says 'not great on its own because you pay a premium for the tag.' Needs Jovian/floater support.

**Синергии:** Jupiter Floating Station, Jovian Lanterns, Saturn Surfing, Titan colony, Unity party

**Когда брать:** In Jovian strategies with floater synergies. The Jovian tag + Space tag combo helps multipliers and Rim Settler.

---

### Neptunian Power Consultants (#X61) — 67/C

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: Power | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 14+3=17 MC (steel-payable via implied cost ~12-13 MC). Action: gain energy-prod + hydroelectric resource per ocean. Power tag (2-3 MC). VP per resource. With 5 oceans over game = 5 VP (25 MC) + energy-prod scaling. Total value ~25-35 MC but spread over many gens.

**Почему C (67):** VP engine tied to ocean placement. Each ocean adds energy production AND a VP resource, making it strong in ocean-heavy games. Steel-payable reduces upfront cost. Power tag is useful. However, the card is slow -- oceans are placed ~1 per gen and you need oceans placed after playing this card. In 3P/WGT with ~6-7 remaining oceans at play time, expect 3-5 VP which is decent for the price. The energy production scaling is gravy. Main risk: game ends before enough oceans are placed.

**Синергии:** Aquifer Pumping, Arctic Algae, Ocean placement strategies, Thorgate, Manutech

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when most oceans remain. Steel-payable helps early play. Skip if 4+ oceans already placed. Best with corps that place oceans efficiently.

---

### Soil Studies (#P81) — 67/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: Max -4°C | Теги: Microbe, Plant | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC for plants per Venus+Plant+Colony tag. Microbe+Plant tags (3-4 MC). With 4 Venus+Plant+colony tags = 4 plants. With 8 tags = 8 plants = 1 greenery. Max -4C req. Total value ~10-20 MC depending on tags. Net -6 to +4 MC.

**Почему C (67):** Scaling event that rewards Venus+Plant+Colony tag diversity. The Microbe+Plant dual tag is useful for NRA, Decomposers, Ecological Zone. At 8+ plants (1 greenery), the card becomes a cheap greenery which is strong. But reaching 8+ qualifying tags requires heavy commitment. The max -4C requirement limits play window to gen 1-4 typically. Triple tag (Microbe+Plant+Event) triggers many combos. Inconsistent -- great when tag-rich, mediocre otherwise.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Decomposers, Ecological Zone, Venus strategies, Colony strategies

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-4 with 4+ Venus/Plant/Colony tags for cheap greenery. Microbe+Plant tags are the floor value. Skip with fewer than 3 qualifying tags.

### Acquired Company (#106) — 66/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 3 MC-prod = 4.33 MC/prod. Good rate. Earth tag worth 2-3 MC. Gen 1 play: 15 MC return by gen 6. Break-even gen 5.

**Почему C (66):** Solid early-game economy card with a valuable Earth tag. At 4.33 MC per MC-prod, it is above average efficiency. The Earth tag adds significant synergy value with Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Cartel. However, it becomes unplayable after gen 3 in 3P/WGT games (~8-9 gens). Strictly an early game card with good tag value.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Cartel, Manutech

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with Earth tag synergies or when Banker award is contested. Skip after gen 3 unless Earth tags matter.

---

### Bactoviral Research (#X35) — 66/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Microbe, Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 1 card (3-4 MC) + Microbe tag (1-2 MC) + Science tag (3-5 MC) + N microbes where N = science tags. With 6 tags: 6 microbes = 3 VP on Ants or 18 MC on Sulphur-Eating Bacteria.

**Почему C (66):** Highly situational but potentially excellent in the right setup. With 6+ Science tags and Ants or Sulphur-Eating Bacteria, this generates 3+ VP or 18+ MC for just 13 MC. The dual Science/Microbe tag is useful. However, without a good microbe dump target, the microbes have little value. The Science tag + card draw make it at least acceptable for engine players. Great ceiling, mediocre floor.

**Синергии:** Ants, Sulphur-Eating Bacteria, Decomposers, Venusian Insects, Enceladus colony

**Когда брать:** When you have 4+ Science tags AND a strong microbe dump (Ants, SEB, Decomposers). Otherwise low priority.

---

### Convoy From Europa (#161) — 66/C

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC for 1 ocean TR (7 MC) + placement bonus (~2-4 MC) + 1 card (3-4 MC) + Space/Event tags. Net cost ~5-8 MC for 1 ocean. Ti-payable.

**Почему C (66):** Same cost as SP ocean but with a free card and event/space tag synergies. Ti-payable is the main draw. With Optimal Aerobraking and ti payment, the effective cost becomes very low. Without discounts, it is merely an SP ocean with a card -- acceptable but not exciting. Consistently playable in terraform strategies. A reliable but unspectacular space event.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Media Group, Phobolog, Tharsis 2-card ocean spot, Solar Logistics

**Когда брать:** When you need an ocean and have titanium. Better with event/space rebates. Medium draft priority.

---

### Dawn City (#220) — 66/C

Стоимость: 15 MC | Требования: 4 Science tags | Теги: City, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 3

**Экономика:** 15 MC (3 MC + ~5 ti) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~25 MC effective. Returns: 3 VP (~15 MC late), 1 ti-prod (~12.5 MC gen1 but usually played late), city tile, Space+City tags (~3 MC).

**Почему C (66):** A solid 3 VP dump card for science engines. The 4 science tag requirement means it's almost always played late game where ti-prod is nearly worthless. As benbever notes, at 18 MC effective cost (with ti payment), 3 VP for ~6 MC/VP is decent for a last-gen play. The Space tag allows ti payment which helps a lot.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Quantum Extractor, Mass Converter, Pets

**Когда брать:** Late game with 4+ science tags and excess energy production. Good last-gen titanium dump.

---

### Envoys From Venus (#P72) — 66/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Требования: 3 Venus tags | Теги: Venus | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 1 MC + 3 MC card = 4 MC cost. Returns: 2 delegates (~10 MC value). Net profit ~6 MC. Requires 3 Venus tags. Venus tag (event).

**Почему C (66):** Extremely cost-efficient if you meet the requirement — 4 MC for 2 delegates is great value. The 3 Venus tag requirement is the real gate. In a Venus-heavy engine with Morning Star Inc this is easy to meet. The delegates can snipe Chairman or force a favorable ruling. Event tag has minor value for Legend/Media Group. Already evaluated at 66 in existing data — consistent with that assessment.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Venus Waystation, Cultural Metropolis synergies, Chairman snipe, Turmoil parties

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game with 3+ Venus tags. Very efficient but highly conditional.

---

### Farming (#118) — 66/C

Стоимость: 16 MC | Требования: 4°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 16 MC + 3 MC card = 19 MC cost. Returns: 2 MC-prod (worth very little late), 2 plant-prod (worth ~6 MC last gen as 4 plants), 2 plants (~4 MC), 2 VP (~10 MC late), Plant tag (~2 MC). Total ~22 MC last gen.

**Почему C (66):** Good value but locked behind a +4°C requirement that usually means last generation play. In last gen: 4 plants (possible half greenery = 1-2 VP) + 2 VP for 19 MC is decent. With Ecology Experts prelude it's incredible in gen 1. Per benbever's analysis, it's a good last-gen steel/MC dump. The Plant tag enables NRA and triggers bio synergies. Temperature being the last parameter often makes this playable only on the final turn.

**Синергии:** Ecology Experts prelude, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, Psychrophiles, Vitor

**Когда брать:** Keep in hand from early game, play last generation. Exceptional with Ecology Experts prelude.

---

### Galilean Waystation (#C13) — 66/C

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 15 MC + 3 MC card = 18 MC cost. Returns: X MC-prod where X = Jovian tags in play (all players) + 1 VP. Typically 2-3 MC-prod (~10-15 MC gen1) + 1 VP (~5 MC). Jovian+Space tags (~6 MC). Total ~21-26 MC.

**Почему C (66):** Solid Jovian support card that benefits from all players' Jovian tags. In 3P with all expansions, typically 2-3 Jovian tags in play by mid-game for 2-3 MC-prod. The Jovian+Space dual tag is excellent for Rim Settler and Jovian multipliers. The 1 VP is a nice bonus. Per COTD, it's reliable but not exciting — the production scales but rarely spectacularly in 3P where Jovian tags are spread thin.

**Синергии:** Jovian multipliers, Ganymede Colony, Io Mining Industries, Rim Settler milestone, Vesta Shipyard

**Когда брать:** Mid game with 3+ total Jovian tags in play. Good for Jovian tag collection strategies.

---

### Industrial Microbes (#158) — 66/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Microbe, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 12 MC + 3 MC card = 15 MC for 1 steel prod (~8 MC) + 1 energy prod (~7.5 MC) = 15.5 MC value. Microbe+Building tags. Fair price gen 1. Steel payable.

**Почему C (66):** Fairly priced production card that combines Mine + Power Plant into one card with a bonus Microbe tag. Solid gen 1 play when you need both productions. The Microbe tag is useful for Ecologist milestone and bio synergies. Steel prod loses value fast after gen 1. Better with Rego Plastics/Advanced Alloys. Good for Electro Catapult combo.

**Синергии:** Electro Catapult, Advanced Alloys, Rego Plastics, Ecologist milestone, Decomposers

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when you need energy production and have steel to spend. Good Electro Catapult enabler.

---

### Methane From Titan (#018) — 66/C

Стоимость: 28 MC | Требования: 2% oxygen | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** Cost 28+3=31 MC (ti payable). Value: 2 heat-prod (8) + 2 plant-prod (16) + 2 VP (10) + Jovian+Space tags (4-7). Total ~38-41 MC. But anti-synergy: heat/plants want rush, Jovian wants engine.

**Почему C (66):** Good value on paper but internally conflicted. Plant+heat production wants early game rush; Jovian tag + VP want long engine games. Futuralis's top comment (30 upvotes) nails this anti-synergy. Best played gen 1-2 with Inventrix or Smelting Plant prelude, but the 2% O2 req often prevents that. Overpriced for late game.

**Синергии:** Inventrix, Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Smelting Plant, Adaptation Technology

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when O2 is already 2%+ and you have titanium. Don't draft for Jovian tag alone -- too expensive.

---

### Peroxide Power (#089) — 66/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 7+3=10 MC (steel payable) + 1 MC-prod lost (5-6). Total ~16 MC gen 1. Value: 2 energy-prod (15) + Power+Building tags (2-3). Total ~17-18 MC. Net ~+1-2.

**Почему C (66):** Good energy source when you need it. The -1 MC-prod is less painful than Nuclear Power's -2. Power+Building tags are useful for milestones. shai_aus prefers it over Nuclear Power. Cheap enough to play mid-game. With colonies it's excellent for enabling trading. Not exciting but functional.

**Синергии:** Colonies (trading), Strip Mine, AI Central, Cities, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** When you need 2 energy production. One of the more efficient energy cards. Good with steel payment.

---

### Protected Valley (#174) — 66/C

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Plant, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 26 MC total (23+3) for greenery + 1 TR + 2 MC-prod + Plant+Building tags. Value: ~14 MC (greenery) + 10 MC (2 MC-prod) + 3 MC (tags) = ~27 MC. Near break-even at full price, good with steel.

**Почему C (66):** Expensive greenery that becomes good with steel payment. No requirements makes it flexible. Plant tag enables NRA. The 2 MC-prod helps if played early-mid. Best as a steel dump. COTD consensus: decent but not exciting, needs steel to be worthwhile.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Credicor, IC (steel), NRA, Gardener milestone, Estate Dealer (Elysium)

**Когда брать:** When you have significant steel production or reserves. Good for surprise Gardener milestone claims.

---

### Solar Reflectors (#C38) — 66/C

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 26 MC total (23+3) for 5 heat prod (~20-30 MC depending on gen). Ti payable. Space tag. 5.2 MC per heat prod = good rate. Smaller, better-priced Soletta.

**Почему C (66):** Best heat production card by MC/prod ratio after Mohole Area per benbever. Gen 1 play enables fast temperature control and ~5 TR over the game. However, 26 MC on heat production is a huge investment that locks you into rushing. Krazyguy75 argues heat is still overvalued. Much better than Soletta. Gen 1-2 play only.

**Синергии:** Phobolog (ti payment), Helion, UNMI, Thermalist award, Rush strategy

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 with titanium to pay. Enables temperature rush strategy. Worthless after gen 2-3.

---

### Space Station (#025) — 66/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13 MC total (10+3) for -2 MC/space card discount + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Space tag. Need 4+ space cards after playing to break even on the discount portion.

**Почему C (66):** Solid for space-heavy engines but takes many cards to pay off. shai_aus is skeptical, noting opportunity cost is high. COTD split: engine players love it, rushers hate it. Better than Shuttles (no requirement, no energy cost) but worse than Research Outpost (universal discount). 1 VP provides floor value. Ti payable for the cost.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Space tag engine, Satellites, Other space discounts (stackable)

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game when planning many space cards. Late game only for VP dump with titanium.

---

### Titan Floating Launch-pad (#C44) — 66/C

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: Jovian | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 18+3=21 MC for Jovian tag + 1 VP + 2 floaters immediate + action: add 1 floater or spend 6 to trade. First 2 trades free. Energy for trade costs ~7-9 MC, so 2 free trades = ~14-18 MC saved.

**Почему C (66):** Provides 2 free trades, then trades every other gen. benbever values it highly but the 21 MC upfront without ti payment is steep. Krazyguy75 notes trading with energy is ~5 MC, so breakeven is 3 trades. Jovian tag is valuable for multipliers. Solid but not game-changing without floater support.

**Синергии:** Stormcraft, Celestic, Saturn Systems, Floater Technology, Hoverlord milestone

**Когда брать:** When you need a trade fleet alternative and/or Jovian tag. Better early when you can use all the free trades.

---

### Titanium Mine (#144) — 66/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for 1 ti-prod (12.5 MC) + Building tag (~1-2 MC). Net value ~3.5 MC gen 1. Breaks even by gen 2. Simple and efficient.

**Почему C (66):** Boring and fine as shai_aus says. 10 MC for 1 ti-prod is a good deal gen 1, paying for itself in 2 turns. Building tag is a small bonus. ad_hocNC warns about Asteroid Mining Consortium stealing it. Low impact but reliable early economy card. Better gen 1-2, skip after gen 3.

**Синергии:** Space cards, Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Steel-payable cards, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 always. Simple production card. Skip after gen 3 as ti-prod loses value.

### Envoys from Venus (#?) — 66/C

Стоимость: ? MC | Теги: — | Тип: ? | Дополнение: ?

**Экономика:** 4 MC за 2 delegates. Req 3 Venus.

**Почему C (66):** Дешёвые delegates. Venus req ограничивает.

**Синергии:** Venus strategy, Turmoil

**Когда брать:** Venus + Turmoil.

---

### Aerial Mappers (#213) — 65/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for 1 VP (5 MC) + Venus tag (2-3 MC) + action: 1 card every 2 gens (~1.5-2 MC/gen). Breakeven in ~4-5 gens.

**Почему C (65):** A solid but slow card-draw engine. 1 free card every 2 gens is decent value, and the ability to add floaters to any card provides flexibility for floater strategies. However, 14 MC is expensive for the slow payoff, and the card is much better in longer engine games. In 3P/WGT where games are ~8-9 gens, you get maybe 3-4 cards total, which is acceptable but not exciting.

**Синергии:** Dirigibles, Titan colony, Stratopolis, Floating Habs, Venus Waystation

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 in a Venus/floater engine. Skip after gen 4 unless you have strong floater synergy.

---

### CEO's Favorite Project (#149) — 65/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 1+3=4 MC for ~1 VP (5 MC) typically. With Physics Complex: 2 VP (10 MC). No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Event with no tags.

**Почему C (65):** Cheap VP card -- 4 MC for 1 VP on a 1-VP-per-animal card, or 2 VP on Physics Complex. The no-tag penalty hurts, but the extremely low cost partially compensates. Event type counts for Legend milestone. Requires a card with resources already on it. Low impact but efficient when you have a good target. Not worth drafting highly but rarely a bad play if you have an animal/science resource card.

**Синергии:** Physics Complex, Birds, Fish, Livestock, Predators

**Когда брать:** When you have a 1-VP animal or Physics Complex with resources. Good for Legend milestone. Low draft priority.

---

### Corona Extractor (#C06) — 65/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: 4 Science tags | Теги: Space, Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC (ti-payable) for 4 energy-prod (30 MC) + Space+Power tags (2-3 MC). 4 Science tag requirement. 3.25 MC/energy-prod is excellent.

**Почему C (65):** Incredible energy production rate (3.25 MC per energy-prod) but locked behind 4 Science tags. The poor man's Quantum Extractor -- cheaper but lacks the -2 space discount and science tag. Ti-payable via Space tag is useful. With Colonies, 4 energy is extremely valuable for trading. The 4 Science requirement means mid-game earliest. No Science tag on it means it does not feed the science engine further.

**Синергии:** Colonies (trading), Science engine, AI Central, Quantum Extractor, City cards

**Когда брать:** When you have 4 Science tags and need energy, especially with Colonies. Ti-payable is a plus.

---

### Directed Heat Usage (#X48) — 65/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 1 MC + 3 MC card = 4 MC cost. Action: 3 heat → 4 MC (~1.5 MC profit) or 3 heat → 2 plants (~3.5 MC profit). No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему C (65):** Cheap and flexible heat conversion. The 2 plants option is quite good (~5 MC value for 3 heat ~3.5 MC). No tags hurts, but the ultra-low cost partially compensates. Per shai_aus, low investment with handy flexibility. Best when heat is abundant (Helion, post-temperature-max). Stall value as a cheap blue action.

**Синергии:** Helion, Sagitta, Community Services, Mass Converter, any heat production

**Когда брать:** When heat production is high and temperature is near max. Good cheap pickup anytime.

---

### Floyd Continuum (#X-1) — 65/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 4 MC + 3 MC card = 7 MC cost. Action: 3 MC per completed parameter (temp, O2, oceans, Venus = 4 total). Late game: 9-12 MC per action. Science tag (~4 MC). No COTD data.

**Почему C (65):** Late-game money generator that scales with terraforming completion. With 3 parameters done: 9 MC per action is excellent. With Venus as 4th: 12 MC. But early game it's nearly worthless. The Science tag is nice for engine builders. No COTD data available so relying on card math. At 7 MC cost with a Science tag, the floor is acceptable and the ceiling (12 MC/action late) is strong. Marked 'no COTD data' for review.

**Синергии:** Science engine, late game economy, Viron, Standard Technology, Venus inclusion

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 for speculation on late-game income. Better in longer games where parameters complete over time.

---

### Great Dam:promo (#X32) — 65/C

Стоимость: 15 MC | Требования: 4 oceans | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 15 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 18 MC cost. Returns: 2 energy-prod (~15 MC gen1) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + tile placement bonus (~3 MC) + Power+Building tags (~3 MC). Total ~26 MC. Req 4 oceans.

**Почему C (65):** Promo version is 3 MC more expensive but adds a tile placement that must be adjacent to ocean. The tile provides a placement bonus and map presence. Per game economics, the 3 MC premium for a tile placement is fair to slightly positive. Otherwise same evaluation as original Great Dam — decent mid-game energy with VP, limited by 4 ocean requirement.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, Physics Complex, Mining Guild, Steelworks, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Mid game with 4+ oceans and good ocean-adjacent placement available. Slightly better than original Great Dam.

---

### Miranda Resort (#051) — 65/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 12+3=15 MC (ti payable). Value: 1 VP (5) + Jovian+Space tags (4-7) + MC-prod per Earth tag. At 3 Earth tags = 15 MC-prod. Total ~24-27 with 3 tags.

**Почему C (65):** Decent MC production if you have 3+ Earth tags, plus Jovian tag for multipliers. But doesn't include its own Earth tag (unlike Cartels), making it strictly worse for economy. The Jovian tag adds value for multipliers and milestones. shai_aus rates Cartels higher. Best for Point Luna/Teractor with many Earth tags.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Cartels, Jovian multipliers, Ganymede Colony

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ Earth tags for MC-prod, or need a cheap Jovian tag. Ti-payable helps late game.

---

### Nitrophilic Moss (#146) — 65/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 3 oceans | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 8+3=11 MC - 2 plants (~4). Value: 2 plant-prod (16 MC gen 1). Net ~+1 to +5 MC. Plant tag (1-2). Req: 3 oceans + 2 plants.

**Почему C (65):** Good plant production card -- basically Algae at 2 MC less with easier requirement (3 oceans vs 5). The 2 plant cost is manageable. icehawk84 calls it underrated and the best of the mosses. Plant tag is useful for NRA/Insects/Ecologist. Not flashy but solid when played early-mid game.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid, Insects, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, Arctic Algae

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-4 when 3 oceans are out and you have 2+ plants. Good plant tag for NRA/Insects synergy.

---

### Noctis City (#017) — 65/C

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 18+3=21 MC (steel payable) + 1 energy-prod (~7.5). Value: 3 MC-prod (15-18) + city (1-3 VP from greeneries) + City+Building tags (2-3). On Tharsis: +3-4 VP from greeneries.

**Почему C (65):** Map-dependent value. On Tharsis it's strong -- the reserved area often has great adjacency for greeneries and the 'surprise city' play catches opponents. icehawk84 rates it very strong on Tharsis, not great elsewhere. The -1 energy-prod cost is annoying early but irrelevant last gen. shai_aus likes it as a late-game play on Tharsis.

**Синергии:** Tharsis map, Mayor milestone, Greenery placement, Steel payment, Robotic Workforce

**Когда брать:** On Tharsis: high priority, buy early and play late for surprise city. On other maps: mediocre, only with excess steel.

---

### Plantation (#193) — 65/C

Стоимость: 15 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 15+3=18 MC. Value: 1 greenery + O2 TR (7-7.4) + placement bonuses (2-4) + Plant tag (1-2). SP greenery = 23 MC. This saves 5 MC. Total ~10-14 MC.

**Почему C (65):** A cheaper standard project greenery (saves 5 MC) with a useful Plant tag. The 2 Science tag requirement is manageable but limits who can play it. Good for NRA enablement and Gardener milestone. ad_hocNC values the plant tag highly. shai_aus calls it fine. No science tag on it means it doesn't feed into science engines.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid, Insects, Gardener milestone, Mars University (for req), Research

**Когда брать:** When you have 2 science tags and need a greenery or plant tag. Mid-game discount on SP greenery.

---

### Self-replicating Robots (#210) — 65/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 10 MC total (7+3) for action: add 2 resource, OR remove resources from card to discount a building/space card by that amount. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Req: 2 Science tags.

**Почему C (65):** Interesting but slow. Needs 4 actions (2 gens) to accumulate enough resources for a meaningful discount. benbever shows gen 1 play leads to 32 MC discount by gen 5. Krazyguy75 argues the effective rate is poor unless you maintain 1 card per 4 turns pace. No tags penalty. Good with Viron. Niche but can be strong when set up properly.

**Синергии:** Viron (double action), Big space/building cards (Deimos Down, Io Mining), Science engine

**Когда брать:** Early game with 2 science tags and expensive cards to target. Loses value after gen 3-4.

---

### Towing A Comet (#075) — 65/C

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 23+3=26 MC (ti-payable) for 1 ocean TR (7 MC) + 1 O2 TR (7 MC) + 2 plants (4 MC) + placement bonus (~2-4 MC). Total ~20-22 MC value at face. Space tag for ti payment brings cost to ~16-18 MC effective.

**Почему C (65):** Standard terraforming event. icehawk84 highlights the 'towing into conversion' play (place ocean, convert plants to greenery for 3 TR in one turn). FieldMouse007 says 'not great points-wise but good enough.' Ti-payable and 20+ MC cost for Credicor discount help. Solid mid-game rusher card.

**Синергии:** Arctic Algae, IC rebate, Credicor, Optimal Aerobraking, Titanium

**Когда брать:** Mid-game when you can pay with ti and combo with plant conversion. Good for rush strategies.

---

### Lava Flows (#140) — 65/C

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 18+3=21 MC for 2 temperature raises (2 TR = 14-14.8 MC) + volcanic tile placement (adjacency, heat bonus). No tags (-3 to -5 MC penalty). Net -6 to -4 MC. Overpriced for pure TR.

**Почему C (65):** 2 TR for 21 MC is below-average rate (10.5 MC per TR vs standard 7-7.4 MC). The volcanic tile placement provides some adjacency value but the restricted placement locations (Tharsis Tholus, Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons, Arsia Mons) limit flexibility. No tags means zero synergy value. The main use case is when you need temperature raises and the tile placement gives adjacency to your existing tiles. Strictly worse than other 2-TR options unless placement location matters. Event card so no lingering value.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild (tile adjacency), Landlord strategies, Temperature-dependent cards

**Когда брать:** When volcanic placement locations align with your tiles and you need TR. Skip if no adjacency value. Generally overpriced -- prefer cheaper TR sources.

---

### Advanced Alloys (#071) — 64/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC. Need to spend 12+ steel/ti to break even. Science tag worth 3-5 MC. With IC (20 steel), value is ~20 MC from steel alone.

**Почему C (64):** Situational card that is good with heavy metal production (IC, Phobolog, Supply Drop) but mediocre otherwise. As COTD commenters note, it is overrated by new players. Many games you do not produce enough metal to justify 12 MC. The Science tag adds value but is not enough on its own. With the right corporation/preludes it can be strong, but often you end up with unused metal anyway.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Phobolog, Mining Guild, Supply Drop, Metal-Rich Asteroid

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with IC, Phobolog, or heavy metal preludes. Skip if you have less than 3 metal-prod or few Building/Space targets.

---

### Bribed Committee (#112) — 64/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: -2

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for 2 TR (14 MC) - 2 VP (-10 MC). Net: 4 MC value. Earth tag (2-3 MC). Immediate TR is valuable early for income.

**Почему C (64):** 2 TR for 10 MC is below-rate (5 MC/TR vs standard 7 MC/TR), but the -2 VP claws back most of the savings. The key insight is that TR gives immediate income while VP only scores at game end. Gen 1-2, each TR produces ~6-7 MC over remaining gens, so 2 TR = 12-14 MC income. The -2 VP costs ~10 MC equivalent. Net benefit from early play is positive. Earth tag adds synergy. Event tag counts for Legend. Gets worse as game progresses.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Media Group, IC, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when you need immediate income boost. The earlier, the better. Skip after gen 4.

### Cryo-Sleep (#C07) — 64/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for Science tag (3-5 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + trade discount (saves 1 energy/MC per trade = ~5-7 MC/gen per fleet). Total ~13-17 MC.

**Почему C (64):** Decent Colonies support card. The -1 trade cost effectively saves 1 energy per trade, which is ~7.5 MC value per gen. With 2 trade fleets the saving doubles. Science tag + VP add ~8-10 MC. At 13 MC total cost, it pays off in 1-2 gens with active trading. However, it is expensive compared to Rim Freighters (7 MC for same effect, Space tag, no VP). Good for science players who trade actively.

**Синергии:** Colonies (trading), Multiple trade fleets, Science engine, Rim Freighters

**Когда брать:** When playing Colonies and need a Science tag. Better with 2+ trade fleets. Skip without active colony trading.

---

### Cupola City (#029) — 64/C

Стоимость: 16 MC | Требования: Max 9% oxygen | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 16 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~26 MC cost. Returns: 3 MC-prod (~15 MC gen1), city tile (~10-16 MC), City+Building tags (~3 MC). Total value ~28-34 MC.

**Почему C (64):** A decent but unexciting city card. Better than SP city but not by a huge margin once you account for the energy production cost. The max 9% oxygen requirement limits late-game play but is rarely an issue. Per shai_aus and benbever, it's middle-of-the-road — playable but not exciting. Steel payability is the main draw.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Tharsis Republic, Cheung Shing Mars, Immigrant City, Rover Construction

**Когда брать:** Early game with steel to dump and spare energy production. Good for Mayor milestone on Tharsis.

---

### Earth Elevator (#C08) — 64/C

Стоимость: 43 MC | Теги: Space, Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 4

**Экономика:** 43 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card = 46 MC cost. Returns: 3 ti-prod (~37.5 MC gen1, ~45 MC with Turmoil) + 4 VP (~20 MC late) + Space+Earth tags (~4 MC). Total ~61-69 MC value gen1.

**Почему C (64):** Massive investment card with awkward timing. Production + VP hybrid means it's suboptimal both early (VP wasted) and late (production wasted). Per community consensus, the 43 MC cost is brutally expensive and essentially ends your turn. Per Krazyguy75, it can be absurd with Turmoil Unity bonus. Best played mid-game gen 3-5, but that timing is hard to hit. Good with Phobolog's starting titanium.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Turmoil Unity, Triton colony, Space tag discounts

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-4 with Phobolog or substantial titanium reserves. Skip if you can't play it before gen 5.

---

### Extremophiles (#224) — 64/C

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: Venus, Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1/3 resources

**Экономика:** 3 MC + 3 MC card = 6 MC cost. Action: add 1 microbe to ANY card. 1 VP per 3 resources. 2 Science tag req. Venus+Microbe tags (~4 MC). Cheapest Venus tag speculation.

**Почему C (64):** Cheap microbe dispenser with VP accumulation. The 'add microbe to ANY card' is the key strength — feeds GHG Producing Bacteria, Ants, or Decomposers. Per warpspeed100, always speculate on if you have science tags. The VP accumulation (1 per 3) is slow on its own but adds up. Venus+Microbe dual tag is good for Venuphile and Splice synergies. At 6 MC it's low-risk speculation.

**Синергии:** GHG Producing Bacteria, Sulphur-Eating Bacteria, Decomposers, Enceladus colony, Ants

**Когда брать:** Early game with 2 science tags and microbe targets. Good cheap Venus tag for speculation.

---

### GHG Factories (#126) — 64/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~21 MC cost. Returns: 4 heat-prod (~16 MC gen1) + Building tag (~2 MC). Total ~18 MC. Slight value deficit.

**Почему C (64):** Decent heat production for temperature rushing. The 4 heat production enables 1 temperature raise every 2 gens (with 8 heat). Per community, heat production is one of the weaker productions but 4 at once is substantial for rushing. The Building tag and steel payability help. However, at full cost (with energy from SP), 21 MC for 16 MC of heat-prod is bad. Only good with cheap/free energy production.

**Синергии:** Helion, Thermalist award, Steelworks, Mining Guild, Temperature bonuses

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with spare energy production and a temperature rushing strategy. Good steel dump.

---

### Great Dam (#136) — 64/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 4 oceans | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 15 MC cost. Returns: 2 energy-prod (~15 MC gen1) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Power+Building tags (~3 MC). Total ~23 MC. Requires 4 oceans.

**Почему C (64):** Solid energy production with VP bonus, but the 4 ocean requirement limits timing. By the time 4 oceans are down, you're in mid-game where energy production is worth less (unless for Colonies). The 1 VP and dual tags add value. Steel payable is good. Per community, it's a decent mid-game play but not exciting. Better than Geothermal Power thanks to the VP, but the requirement hurts flexibility.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, Physics Complex, Mining Guild, Steelworks, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Mid game with 4+ oceans and need for energy production. Good steel dump with tags and VP.

---

### Heather (#88) — 64/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: -14°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 6 MC + 3 MC card = 9 MC for 1 plant prod (~8 MC) + 1 plant (~1 MC) + Plant tag (~2 MC) = ~11 MC value. Fair price, slightly positive.

**Почему C (64):** Decent but unremarkable plant production card. The -14C requirement means it's playable early-mid game in most games. Plant tag is valuable for NRA, Insects, Ecologist milestone. Not exciting but solid role-player that fills a niche. Compared to better options like Bushes or Kelp Farming, it's underwhelming.

**Синергии:** Insects, NRA, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, GMO Contract

**Когда брать:** When building plant engine and need cheap plant tags. Don't prioritize in draft unless plant synergies are strong.

---

### Jupiter Floating Station (#C19) — 64/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 3 Science tags | Теги: Jovian | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 9 MC + 3 MC card = 12 MC for Jovian tag (~3-5 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Action: add floater/spend 4 floaters for 4 MC. Requires 3 Science tags. Cheap Jovian tag.

**Почему C (64):** Primarily valued as a cheap Jovian tag for multiplier VP. The floater action is slow (4 turns to activate MC mode) and the 4 MC payoff is mediocre. The 3 Science tag requirement delays deployment. Best as a floater holder for Titan colony and other floater placement cards. The MC generation is just a bonus if it activates.

**Синергии:** Titan colony, Jovian Lanterns, Jovian multipliers, Red Spot Observatory

**Когда брать:** When you need a cheap Jovian tag for multipliers and have 3 Science tags. Or as a floater target for Titan colony.

---

### Maxwell Base (#238) — 64/C

Стоимость: 18 MC | Требования: 12% Venus | Теги: City, Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 3

**Экономика:** Cost 18+3=21 MC + 1 energy-prod (~7.5). Value: 3 VP (15) + City+Venus tags (3) + action (free floater/animal). Total ~18+action. Net slightly negative without synergy.

**Почему C (64):** The 3 VP is decent but expensive. The action becomes strong with Stratospheric Birds (free VP per gen). Without a floater/animal target, it's an overpriced VP card. The 12% Venus requirement and energy cost limit when it can be played. icehawk84 notes it scores heavily with the right target.

**Синергии:** Stratospheric Birds, Venusian Animals, Morning Star Inc, Dirigibles, Titan Floating Launch-pad

**Когда брать:** When you have a 1VP animal/floater card to feed. Late-game 3 VP dump if Venus is high. Strong with Strat Birds combo.

---

### Power Plant (#141) — 64/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 7 MC total (4+3) for 1 energy prod (worth ~7.5 MC). Fair price but low impact. Two tags (Power+Building) add ~2-3 MC value. Steel payable.

**Почему C (64):** Solid utility card with good tags for its cost, but very low impact. It is never a high draft priority, just a reliable filler when you need energy. Better with steel or discounts. COTD confirms it is a 'keeper but not exciting' card.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, AI Central, Cheung Shing Mars, Electro Catapult, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Early-mid game when you need energy production and have steel to spend. Good filler in weak draft packs.

---

### Refugee Camps (#C33) — 64/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 13 MC total (10+3) for 1 VP/gen action (costs -1 MC-prod each). Played 3 gens before end: 13+3 MC-prod-loss = 16 MC for 3 VP = 5.3 MC/VP. Earth tag worth 2-3 MC.

**Почему C (64):** Decent VP card when played 3-4 gens before game end with excess MC production. FieldMouse007 says 'strong but tricky to use.' Each VP costs 1 MC-prod, which is painful early but fine late. Earth tag is nice. Camp resources cannot be eaten by Predators/Virus. Safe but unexciting VP engine.

**Синергии:** High MC-prod engines, Earth tag synergies, Diversifier milestone (unique resource)

**Когда брать:** Mid-game when you have high MC production and 3+ gens remaining. Not worth forcing.

---

### Soil Enrichment (#X67) — 64/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Microbe, Plant | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 9 MC total (6+3) + 1 microbe = 10-12 MC total for 5 plants (~11 MC, 5/8 of a greenery). Microbe+Plant event tags. Good tags for synergies.

**Почему C (64):** Decent late-game card for converting a spare microbe into 5 plants (often enough for a greenery with existing plants). Microbe+Plant tags trigger many synergy effects. FieldMouse007 calls it 'fine.' SoupsBane shows it is roughly fairly priced. Best when the microbe would otherwise be wasted (odd number on half-VP card).

**Синергии:** Viral Enhancers, Decomposers, Topsoil Contract, Microbe cards with spare resources

**Когда брать:** Late game when you have a spare microbe and need plants for a greenery. Good free draw.

---

### Sponsors (#068) — 64/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for 2 MC-prod + Earth tag. 4.5 MC/prod is decent. Earth tag worth ~2-3 MC. Total value ~12-13 MC gen 1 over 8 gens. Breaks even by gen 5.

**Почему C (64):** Basic economy card that is fine early but drops off sharply. benbever confirms 4.5 MC/prod is good, but Krazyguy75 argues 18 MC return from 9 MC invested over 10 gens is not impressive. Earth tag adds genuine value with Point Luna, Teractor, Cartels. Solid but not exciting.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Cartels, Banker award

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3, or if Earth tag has strong synergy with your corp/engine. Skip after gen 4.

---

### Supported Research (#T14) — 64/C

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: Scientists ruling | Теги: Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 3+3=6 MC for 2 cards (6-8 MC) + Science tag (~3-5 MC). Net positive on card value alone. Cheapest Science tag along with Search for Life.

**Почему C (64):** Great card for its cost when the Scientists requirement is met - effectively free card draw with a valuable science tag. However, Scientists are rarely ruling, and placing 2 delegates costs resources. benbever notes it's 'best played midgame when you may need cards or science tags.' Turmoil requirement adds variance.

**Синергии:** Scientists party, AI Central, Mass Converter, Olympus Conference, Mars University

**Когда брать:** When Scientists are ruling or you have 2 delegates there. Cheap science tag is always welcome but the requirement limits reliability.

---

### Toll Station (#099) — 64/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC (ti-payable) for 1 MC-prod per opponent Space tag. In 3P: typically 2-4 opponent space tags gen 1. At 3 tags: 3.75 MC/prod decent. Late game: Banker award swing.

**Почему C (64):** Highly variable. benbever does detailed analysis showing it needs 4+ opponent space tags gen 1 to compete with Acquired Company. In 3P with all expansions, that's uncommon early. Best value is as a late-game Banker award swing card. Prelude 2 adds more space tags making it slightly better.

**Синергии:** Banker award, Space-heavy opponents, Titanium payment, Phobolog, Point Luna metagame

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 if opponents have 3+ space tags. Late game for Banker award. In 3P, usually a mid-tier card.

---

### Worms (#130) — 64/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 4% oxygen | Теги: Microbe | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for N plant-prod where N = microbe tags/2 (including this). At 3 microbe tags: 2 plant-prod (16 MC). At 5: 3 plant-prod (24 MC). Microbe tag ~1-2 MC. Req 4% O2.

**Почему C (64):** Scaling plant production based on microbe tags. At 3 microbe tags total it's already decent (16 MC for 11 MC). At 5+ tags it's excellent. The 4% O2 requirement is moderate. Microbe tag contributes to Ecologist and enables microbe synergies. Key card in bio-heavy strategies.

**Синергии:** Decomposers, Tardigrades, Symbiotic Fungus, Ecologist milestone, NRA

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ microbe tags and expect more. Scales very well in microbe-heavy builds. 4% O2 is usually met by gen 3-4.

---

### Protected Growth (#X73) — 64/C

Стоимость: 2 MC | Требования: Max 7% oxygen | Теги: Plant | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 2+3=5 MC for plants per Power tag. Plant tag (1-2 MC). Max 7% O2 req. With 3 Power tags = 3 plants (2.4 MC). With 5+ Power tags = 5+ plants (half greenery). Net -2.6 MC at 3 tags, +1-3 MC at 5+ tags.

**Почему C (64):** Extremely cheap scaling event. At 5 MC total cost, even 3 plants (3 Power tags) is near break-even and the Plant tag helps for NRA/Ecological Zone. With 5+ Power tags this becomes a cheap half-greenery which is strong. The max 7% O2 requirement limits window to gen 1-4. The floor is bad (1-2 Power tags = terrible value) but the ceiling is good (6+ Power tags = great). Inconsistent card that needs specific engine to shine.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Energy-heavy strategies, Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Power tag engines

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with 3+ Power tags played or planned. Plant tag has NRA synergy. Skip with fewer than 3 Power tags -- too little value.

---

### Artificial Lake (#116) — 63/C

Стоимость: 15 MC | Требования: -6°C | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC for 1 ocean (14 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Building tag (1-2 MC). Total ~20 MC. Steel-payable. Same cost as SP ocean but with VP and placement flexibility.

**Почему C (63):** Effectively an SP ocean with 1 VP and flexible placement for the same price. Steel-payable is nice. The special placement on non-ocean areas is situationally valuable for Estate Dealer award, blocking opponents, or Capital synergy. The -6C requirement means oceans might already be gone. Decent steel dump with a VP bonus but nothing exciting.

**Синергии:** Estate Dealer award, Capital, Mining Guild, Rego Plastics, Advanced Alloys

**Когда брать:** When you have steel surplus and -6C is met. Good for Estate Dealer on Elysium. Medium priority.

---

### Crash Site Cleanup (#X17) — 63/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: {'plantsRemoved': True} | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for 1 VP (5 MC) + 1 ti (3 MC) or 2 steel (4 MC). Net cost ~0-1 MC for 1 VP. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Requirement: plant removal this gen.

**Почему C (63):** Nearly free VP when the requirement is met. 7 MC minus 3-4 MC resource gain = 3-4 MC for 1 VP, which is one of the cheapest VPs available. The no-tag penalty and event-with-no-tags limitation hurt. The requirement (plants removed this gen) is met in most games since asteroids are common. You can even trigger it yourself. Low impact but efficient. Good as a wheel pick in draft.

**Синергии:** Asteroid events, Media Group, IC, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Low draft priority but keep if you have or expect plant removal events. Nearly free VP.

---

### Eos Chasma National Park (#026) — 63/C

Стоимость: 16 MC | Требования: -12°C | Теги: Plant, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 16 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 19 MC cost. Returns: 2 MC-prod (~10 MC gen1), 1 VP (~5 MC), 3 plants (~6 MC), 1 animal to another card (~5 MC), Plant+Building tags (~3 MC). Total ~29 MC.

**Почему C (63):** A decent steel dump with lots of small bonuses. Per benbever, good mid-late game if you have steel and plant synergy. The -12°C requirement limits timing. The 1 animal is only valuable if you have a 1-VP-per-animal card already. Per shai_aus, it's a bit expensive for what it does and needs an animal card to be worth it. The Plant+Building tags help NRA and Builder.

**Синергии:** Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, Decomposers, Pets, Mining Guild

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game with steel, an animal card in play, and plant synergy. Decent steel dump for last generation.

---

### Floater Prototypes (#C11) — 63/C

Стоимость: 2 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: event | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 2 MC + 3 MC card = 5 MC cost. Returns: 2 floaters to another card. Typically worth 1 VP, 1 TR, 1 MC-prod, or 1 card draw depending on target. Science tag (event) ~4 MC.

**Почему C (63):** Cheap and efficient when you have a good floater target. 2 floaters typically translate to 1 TR or 1 VP worth ~5-7 MC, making this 5 MC for ~5-7 MC value — a small profit. The Science tag triggers Mars University and Olympus Conference. Per community, it's not always worth drafting at 3 MC, but great when drawn for free. Best with high-value floater targets like Forced Precipitation (instant Venus raise) or Aerial Mappers.

**Синергии:** Aerial Mappers, Floating Habs, Forced Precipitation, Mars University, Olympus Conference

**Когда брать:** When you have a strong floater target and need a cheap Science tag trigger. Low priority without targets.

---

### Fusion Power (#132) — 63/C

Стоимость: 14 MC | Требования: 2 Power tags | Теги: Science, Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 14 MC + 3 MC card = 17 MC cost. Returns: 3 energy-prod (~22.5 MC gen1) + Power+Building tags (~3 MC). Total ~25.5 MC. Requires 2 Power tags.

**Почему C (63):** Strong energy production card with restrictive requirement. 3 energy production for 17 MC is excellent efficiency (~5.7 MC per energy-prod). However, 2 Power tags are relatively rare and hard to accumulate quickly. Per community, the Power+Building dual tags are decent. Best with Thorgate (already has Power tag on corp). The energy is valuable for Colonies trading, city cards, and Physics Complex.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Energy Market, Colonies trading, Physics Complex, Steelworks

**Когда брать:** When you already have 2 Power tags (usually gen 2-4). Excellent energy efficiency when the requirement is met.

---

### Io Sulphur Research (#232) — 63/C

Стоимость: 17 MC | Теги: Science, Jovian | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 17 MC + 3 MC card = 20 MC for 2 VP (~10 MC) + Science+Jovian tags (~6-8 MC) + 1 card (3 MC) or 3 cards with 3 Venus tags (~10 MC). Without Venus tags: ~19 MC value. With: ~28 MC value.

**Почему C (63):** Overpriced without the 3 Venus tag bonus. At 20 MC for 2 VP and 1 card, you're paying a premium for the Science+Jovian tags. With 3 Venus tags the 3 cards make it reasonable. Not ti-payable which hurts. Late game Science+Jovian tags can be very valuable for multiplier VP and engine payoffs. Very situational.

**Синергии:** Jovian multipliers, Science engine, Venusian Animals, Venus tag strategy

**Когда брать:** When you need Science+Jovian tags and have 3+ Venus tags for the bonus cards. Otherwise pass.

---

### Jovian Envoys (#P77) — 63/C

Стоимость: 2 MC | Требования: 2 Jovian tags | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 2 MC + 3 MC card = 5 MC for 2 delegates (SP ~10 MC). Saves 5 MC. Requires 2 Jovian tags. No tags on card = no synergy.

**Почему C (63):** Good value for delegate placement if you're already playing Jovians. Getting 2 delegates for 5 MC vs 10 MC standard is solid savings. Can secure Chairman or party control. But the 2 Jovian tag requirement limits it to Jovian strategies, and no tags on the card itself (event, no tags) means no ongoing value. Situationally strong in Turmoil games.

**Синергии:** Chairman control, Turmoil party strategy, Jovian strategy

**Когда брать:** When playing Jovians in Turmoil games and need delegate placement. Otherwise not worth drafting.

---

### Local Heat Trapping (#190) — 63/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 1 MC + 3 MC card = 4 MC + 5 heat (~6.25 MC) = ~10 MC cost. Gain 4 plants (~8 MC) or 2 animals on 1VP card (2 VP = ~10 MC). No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему C (63):** Efficient conversion of surplus heat into plants or animal VP. The animal mode is excellent on a 1VP animal card (2 VP for ~10 MC). Plant mode gives half a greenery. No tags is a real penalty but the low cost and heat-to-value conversion make it worthwhile. Best as a free draw when you have surplus heat. Low impact but positive expected value.

**Синергии:** 1VP animal cards, Helion, High heat production, Penguins

**Когда брать:** When you have surplus heat and a 1VP animal card. Good as a free draw. Don't draft early without heat production.

---

### Medical Lab (#207) — 63/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 13+3=16 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 VP (5) + Science+Building tags (4-7) + 1 MC-prod per 2 building tags. At 4 buildings = 2 MC-prod (10-12). Total ~19-24.

**Почему C (63):** Situationally good but requires many building tags to be efficient. In all-expansion play, building tag density is lower than base game. Krazyguy75 notes expansions hurt this card. The Science+Building tag combo is excellent for milestones/awards. Best with Mining Guild or steel-heavy strategies.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Robotic Workforce, Interplanetary Cinematics, Builder milestone, Scientist award

**Когда брать:** When you have 4+ building tags and can pay with steel. Good late-game steel dump for VP + science tag.

---

### Molecular Printing (#C27) — 63/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 11+3=14 MC. Value: 1 VP (5) + Science tag (3-5) + 1 MC per city and colony in play. In 3P late game: ~8-12 cities+colonies = 8-12 MC. Net ~2-8 MC.

**Почему C (63):** Player-count and timing dependent. In 3P with colonies, late game could see 8-12 combined cities+colonies. The science tag and 1 VP are always useful. Krazyguy75 rates it balanced to bonkers depending on context. FieldMouse007 calls it mediocre. In 3P all-expansions it's solidly average -- a free VP+science tag with some MC back.

**Синергии:** Science-heavy strategies, Mars University, Olympus Conference, Late-game play

**Когда брать:** Late game when colonies and cities have accumulated. The science tag may enable other plays.

---

### Public Baths (#X70) — 63/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 6 oceans | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 9 MC total (6+3) - 6 MC refund = net 3 MC for 1 VP + Building tag. Very efficient VP. Steel payable makes it even cheaper.

**Почему C (63):** Cheap VP card with 6 ocean requirement. Net cost of ~3 MC for 1 VP is excellent. Building tag adds utility. Requirement means mid-late game play. Simple, efficient, low-impact card. icehawk84 notes it breaks pricing principles at just 3 MC net for a VP.

**Синергии:** Steel corps (IC, Mining Guild), Builder milestone, Credicor (total cost 20+)

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game when 6 oceans are placed. Very good free draw, decent late draft pick for easy VP.

---

### Small Animals (#054) — 63/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 6% oxygen | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 9 MC total (6+3) for half-VP animal action + Animal tag. 6% O2 requirement. -1 plant prod (take-that minor). Typically 2 VP self-generated. Animal tag adds synergy value.

**Почему C (63):** Half-VP animals are significantly weaker than full-VP ones like Birds/Fish. 2 VP for 9 MC is decent but not exciting. The -1 plant prod in 3P is a minor take-that penalty. Animal tag provides Eco Zone/Decomposers synergy. benbever notes it is good with Large Convoy placement. Solid but uninspiring.

**Синергии:** Large Convoy, Ecological Zone, Meat Industries, Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems

**Когда брать:** When you need an animal tag/placement target and have no better options. Mid-game play.

---

### Urban Decomposers (#C48) — 63/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 1 colonies / 1 city | Теги: Microbe | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for 1 plant-prod (8 MC) + 2 microbes on another card (~2-5 MC) + Microbe tag (~1-2 MC). Req 1 city + 1 colony. Total ~11-15 MC value.

**Почему C (63):** Decent cheap card when requirements are met (usually gen 2-3). benbever says 9 MC for a plant production is 'not bad at all' and the 2 microbes add value. Similar to Archaebacteria but for mid-game. The dual requirement of city + colony is usually easy by mid-game. Good filler with microbe synergy.

**Синергии:** GHG Producing Bacteria, Ants, Psychrophiles, Sulphur-Eating Bacteria, Viral Enhancers

**Когда брать:** When you have a city + colony and a good microbe target. Cheap enough to include in most bio strategies.

---

### Vesta Shipyard (#057) — 63/C

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC (ti-payable) for 1 ti-prod (12.5 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Jovian+Space tags (~5-7 MC). Total value ~23-25 MC. Jovian tag premium: only paying ~1 MC for the tag.

**Почему C (63):** benbever calculates you pay only 1 MC for the Jovian tag over the ti-prod + VP. With Saturn Systems, it's excellent (+1 MC-prod too). The Jovian tag adds multiplier potential. shai_aus says 'decent.' Late game it's a ti dump for 1 VP. Solid Jovian economy card but not spectacular on its own.

**Синергии:** Saturn Systems, Io Mining Industries, Terraforming Ganymede, Rim Settler milestone, Jovian multipliers

**Когда брать:** With Jovian strategy or Saturn Systems. Also fine as early ti-prod + Jovian tag. Skip if no Jovian synergy.

### Energy Tapping (#201) — 63/C

Стоимость: 3 MC | Теги: Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 3+3=6 MC for steal 1 energy-prod (7 MC gained for you, ~7 MC lost for opponent) - 1 VP (5 MC). Power tag (2-3 MC). Net +3-4 MC. Take-that penalty in 3P: -5 to -10 MC score adjustment.

**Почему C (63):** Cheap Power tag with take-that energy steal. The energy steal is worth ~14 MC swing (7 MC for you + 7 MC denied to opponent) but the -1 VP and 3P take-that dynamics reduce the value significantly. Helps third player by weakening one opponent. Power tag is the main draw for milestone/award and energy requirements. In 2P this would be much stronger. In 3P/WGT the take-that penalty caps it at C-tier. Only worth it when the Power tag matters or when the target has excess energy.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Power tag requirements, Energy-dependent strategies

**Когда брать:** When you need a cheap Power tag and the energy steal target has excess energy they cannot use. Skip if target is using all their energy -- helps third player too much.

### Summit Logistics (#P85) — 63/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: Scientists ruling | Теги: Building, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 1 MC per planet tag + colony + 2 cards drawn (6 MC). Building+Space tags (3-5 MC). Scientists ruling req. With 3 planet tags + 2 colonies = 5 MC + 6 MC cards + tags. Total ~14-16 MC. Net +1 to +3 MC.

**Почему C (63):** Solid but requires Scientists ruling or 2 delegates in Scientists party. Building+Space dual tag is premium (steel and ti payable). 2 cards drawn = 6 MC value. The MC per planet tag + colony is variable but typically 3-6 MC in all-expansion games. The Scientists requirement is the main barrier -- not always controllable. When it fires with good tag count and card draw, it is efficient. But the conditional nature and moderate payoff keep it in C-tier.

**Синергии:** Turmoil Scientists party, Colony strategies, Building+Space engines

**Когда брать:** When Scientists are ruling or you have 2 delegates there. Best with 3+ planet tags and colonies. Skip if Scientists party is not accessible.

---

### Venus Shuttles (#P89) — 63/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC for action: add 2 floaters to Venus card. Venus tag (2-3 MC). Floaters accumulate slowly. 2 floaters/gen supports Venus raise via Dirigibles (2 floaters = 1 Venus step). Net value depends on floater usage. Break-even gen 4-5.

**Почему C (63):** Floater generation action for Venus engines. 2 floaters per gen is decent but slow -- need a strong Venus floater target (Dirigibles, Stratospheric Birds, Floating Habs) to convert floaters into VP or TR. Venus tag triggers Aphrodite and Venus counting cards. The 12 MC cost is moderate for a support card. Without good floater targets this is dead weight. In Venus-focused games with Dirigibles it becomes much stronger as each action effectively = 1 Venus raise. Otherwise it is a slow floater drip.

**Синергии:** Dirigibles, Stratospheric Birds, Floating Habs, Aphrodite, Celestic, Morning Star Inc

**Когда брать:** When running Venus floater strategy with Dirigibles or Floating Habs. Skip without strong floater payoffs. Venus tag is the floor value.

---

### Vermin (#X75) — 63/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Microbe, Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: special

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for Microbe+Animal tags (4-6 MC combo) + action: accumulate animals. If 10+ animals reached (5+ gens), ALL players lose 1 VP per city. Net value depends on city differential. VP attack is symmetric but city-light players benefit.

**Почему C (63):** Unique griefing card with Microbe+Animal dual tag. The 10-animal threshold takes 5+ gens to reach, making the VP attack a late-game threat. If you have fewer cities than opponents, the symmetric -1 VP/city benefits you. The Microbe+Animal tag combo is premium for Ecological Zone, Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems. Most of the value is in the tags rather than the VP attack mechanic. The action to add animals is free. In practice, the VP attack rarely fires (need 10 animals = gen 5 at earliest) and is hard to control.

**Синергии:** Ecological Zone, Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems, Viral Enhancers, City-light strategies

**Когда брать:** For the Microbe+Animal tag combo, not the VP attack. Best with bio-tag synergies. The VP mechanic is a bonus if game goes long and you have few cities.

---

### 16 Psyche (#X44) — 62/C

Стоимость: 31 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 31+3=34 MC for 2 ti-prod (25 MC) + 3 ti (9 MC) + 2 VP (10 MC) = 44 MC value. Net +10, but heavy upfront cost. Ti-payable via Space tag helps. 4.25 MC/ti-prod effective.

**Почему C (62):** Decent ti-production card with 2 VP and immediate titanium, but very expensive upfront (34 MC). The Space tag helps pay with titanium. Comparable to Asteroid Mining but slightly better value due to immediate ti and lower real cost after ti offset. Still, the high investment gen 1 is crippling and you need space cards to spend the titanium on.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Saturn Systems, Mass Converter, Mercurian Alloys

**Когда брать:** When you have ti-production or Phobolog and need a ti dump with VP. Best gen 1-2, skip after gen 3.

---

### Breathing Filters (#114) — 62/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: 7% oxygen | Теги: Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for 2 VP (10 MC) + Science tag (3-5 MC). Total ~13-15 MC. Fair value. 7% oxygen requirement is mid-game.

**Почему C (62):** Simple VP card: 2 VP + Science tag for 14 MC. At 7 MC/VP, it is fair but not exciting. The Science tag adds value for engine players needing science requirements. The 7% oxygen requirement means mid-to-late game play, which is fine since VP cards are better later. Consistent, reliable, never exciting. Good Science tag enabler when you need one more.

**Синергии:** Science requirement cards, Scientist award, Diversifier milestone

**Когда брать:** When you need a Science tag and 7% oxygen is close. Acceptable as a late-game VP dump. Not high priority.

---

### Building Industries (#065) — 62/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC + 1 energy-prod (~7.5 MC) = 16.5 MC effective. 2 steel-prod (16 MC). Building tag (1-2 MC). Fair conversion.

**Почему C (62):** Cheap energy-to-steel conversion at 9 MC sticker price. If you have unused energy production, converting 1 energy-prod to 2 steel-prod is excellent (energy=7.5, steel=16). But if you need a SP Power Plant for the energy, total cost balloons to 20 MC. The Building tag is useful for milestones. Best with excess energy from other cards. Situationally good but requires the right setup.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Beam From A Thorium Asteroid, Mass Converter, Builder milestone, Contractor award

**Когда брать:** When you have energy-prod to spare and want steel for building cards. Gen 1-3 with energy prelude.

---

### Diaspora Movement (#TO4) — 62/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: Reds ruling | Теги: Jovian | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 7 MC + 3 MC card = 10 MC cost. Returns: 1 VP (~5 MC late) + X MC where X = Jovian tags in play. With 3-4 Jovian tags: 3-4 MC back. Net cost ~3-6 MC for 1 VP + Jovian tag (~4 MC).

**Почему C (62):** A niche Jovian tag card with 1 VP. The MC gain is nice but not transformative. The Reds ruling requirement adds friction — you may need to spend delegates. Per benbever, with Jovian multipliers this can be worth up to 5 VP, but that's the ceiling case. The Jovian tag is the real value. Boring but occasionally useful.

**Синергии:** Ganymede Colony, Jovian multipliers, Io Mining Industries, Vesta Shipyard, Rim Settler milestone

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game with 2+ Jovian tags and Reds conveniently ruling or delegates to spare.

---

### Floater Technology (#C12) — 62/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 7 MC + 3 MC card = 10 MC cost. Action: 1 floater to ANOTHER card per gen. Science tag (~4 MC). Floater value depends on target: ~1.5-3 MC per gen effective.

**Почему C (62):** An affordable Science tag with floater dispensing action. Per benbever, the floater can translate to half a card, half a TR, or half a VP per gen depending on target. At 10 MC total with the Science tag, it's reasonable if you have even one good floater target. Per PanzerWatts, without a floater target the 10 MC Science tag is expensive compared to other options. Cheap enough for low-risk speculation.

**Синергии:** Aerial Mappers, Floating Habs, Forced Precipitation, Deuterium Export, Titan Floating Launchpad

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-4 with at least one floater card in play. Good cheap Science tag for Warp Drive or Anti-Gravity requirements.

---

### Fuel Factory (#180) — 62/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 6 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card + ~7 MC energy prod = ~16 MC cost. Returns: 1 ti-prod (~12.5 MC gen1) + 1 MC-prod (~5 MC gen1) + Building tag (~2 MC). Total ~19.5 MC.

**Почему C (62):** Decent value if you have spare energy production, but a trap if you need to buy energy. Per icehawk84, top 10 overrated card — people overplay it mid-game. Per shai_aus, it's not as cheap as it appears due to hidden energy cost. Per benbever, good value for money gen 1 with pre-existing energy production. The titanium production is the draw, but only worthwhile if you have space cards to spend it on.

**Синергии:** Advanced Alloys, Phobolog, Mercurian Alloys, Thorgate, Asteroid Mining Consortium

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with spare energy production from preludes/corp. Skip if you'd need to SP Power Plant first.

---

### Herbivores (#147) — 62/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 8% oxygen | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 12 MC + 3 MC card = 15 MC. 8% oxygen requirement = mid-late game. Gains ~1 VP per 2 greeneries placed (by anyone). Self-scores 2-4 VP typically. Take-that component (-1 plant prod) in 3P is a minus.

**Почему C (62):** Interesting VP-generating animal card but awkward execution. The 8% oxygen requirement means it comes online mid-late game when fewer greeneries are being placed. The 1/2 VP per resource ratio is half of Birds/Fish. Plant prod attack in 3P helps the third player. Better in base game without expansions diluting the deck.

**Синергии:** Protected Habitats, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, Arklight

**Когда брать:** When you need an animal tag and can't find Birds/Fish/Livestock. Better in plant-heavy metagames where many greeneries are placed.

---

### Inventors' Guild (#006) — 62/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 9 MC + 3 MC card = 12 MC for Science tag + repeatable card draw (3 MC per card kept). Over 5 gens: 5 draws, maybe keep 3 = 12 + 9 = 21 MC for 3 cards. ~7 MC/card is expensive.

**Почему C (62):** Continuous card draw is powerful in TM but this implementation is expensive and slow. At 12 MC upfront plus 3 MC per card kept, the per-card cost is high. In 8-gen games with WGT, you get maybe 4-5 uses which isn't enough to justify the investment. Better in longer 2P games. The Science tag is its saving grace for milestone/payoff purposes.

**Синергии:** Mars University, AI Central, Terralabs, Valley Trust

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-3 when building science engine and game looks to go 9+ gens. Pass in short 8-gen games unless you need the Science tag.

---

### Lake Marineris (#053) — 62/C

Стоимость: 18 MC | Требования: 0°C | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 18 MC + 3 MC card = 21 MC. 2 VP + 2 oceans (2 TR + placement bonuses). At full value: ~24-28 MC. But requires 0C AND 2 ocean spots available. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему C (62):** When played for full value (both oceans), it's one of the best cards in the game. But the 0C requirement combined with needing 2 ocean spots makes full value uncommon in 3P. Oceans typically fill before temp hits 0C. No tags means no discounts, no synergies. Even for 2 VP alone at 21 MC it's poor. High variance card - amazing ceiling, disappointing floor.

**Синергии:** Heat rush strategy, Special Design, Inventrix, Arctic Algae

**Когда брать:** Speculate in opening hand if you plan to rush temperature. Draft mid-game only if oceans remain near 0C temp.

---

### Lichen (#159) — 62/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: -24°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 7 MC + 3 MC card = 10 MC for 1 plant prod (~8 MC) + Plant tag (~2 MC). Requires -24C. Total: ~10 MC value. Fair price.

**Почему C (62):** Decent cheap plant card playable relatively early (-24C is often gen 1-2). The Plant tag is valuable for NRA, Insects, and Ecologist milestone. At 10 MC for 10 MC value it's break-even, but the early playability and tag value push it to useful territory. Not exciting but reliable. Good role-player for plant strategies.

**Синергии:** NRA, Insects, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers, Ecologist milestone

**Когда брать:** When building plant strategy and need cheap plant tags. Draft priority goes up with NRA/Insects in hand.

---

### Lightning Harvest (#046) — 62/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 3 Science tags | Теги: Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 8 MC + 3 MC card = 11 MC for 1 energy prod (~7.5 MC) + 1 MC-prod (~5 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Power tag (~1 MC). Requires 3 Science tags. Total: ~18.5 MC value.

**Почему C (62):** Good value at 11 MC for ~18 MC when requirements are met. The 3 Science tag requirement limits it to science engine players who often have better options (Quantum Extractor, Mass Converter). The Power tag is niche. The card is efficient but rarely urgent or game-changing. You need to happen to have 3 Science tags, need energy, and have this in hand simultaneously.

**Синергии:** AI Central, Science engine, Colony trading, Energizer milestone

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ Science tags and need energy production. Good incidental value, not a strategy-defining pick.

---

### Lunar Beam (#030) — 62/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Earth, Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 13 MC + 3 MC card + 10 MC (-2 MC-prod) = ~26 MC effective cost. Gain 2 heat prod (~8 MC) + 2 energy prod (~15 MC) + Earth+Power tags (~3 MC) = ~26 MC value. Break-even.

**Почему C (62):** Fair-priced but painful production card. The -2 MC-prod is a significant hit early game when MC is most valuable. The combined heat + energy production is strong for rushing or colony trading. Earth+Power tags provide some synergy value. Much better with Teractor/Earth Office where the MC-prod loss is offset. Good for heat terraforming strategy that also needs energy.

**Синергии:** Teractor, Earth Office, Thorgate, Cartel, Colony trading

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when going heat rush AND need energy for colonies/other cards. Better with Earth tag discounts.

---

### Magnetic Shield (#X24) — 62/C

Стоимость: 24 MC | Требования: 3 Power tags | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 24+3=27 MC (ti payable). Value: 4 TR = ~29.6 MC. Net ~+3 MC. Space tag worth 1-2 MC. Requirement: 3 Power tags is steep.

**Почему C (62):** Good value on paper -- 4 TR for 27 MC is solid, especially titanium-payable. But 3 Power tags is a difficult requirement that limits when this can be played. Per COTD experts, it's a fine VP dump card but you can't rely on meeting the requirements. Niche but decent when it works.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Mass Converter, Thorgate, Quantum Extractor, Nuclear Power

**Когда брать:** When you already have 2 power tags and titanium to spend. Late-game titanium dump when requirements are met.

---

### Moss (#122) — 62/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: 3 oceans | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 4+3=7 MC - 1 plant (~2). Value: 1 plant-prod (8 MC) + Plant tag (1-2). Total ~9-10 MC. Net ~0-3 MC accounting for plant loss.

**Почему C (62):** Simple, cheap plant production with a useful Plant tag. The 3 ocean requirement is easy to meet by gen 2-3. Losing 1 plant is minor. shai_aus calls it perfectly fine mid-tier. The Plant tag is valuable for NRA/Insects. Not exciting but functional. Better as part of a plant engine than standalone.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen-Rich Asteroid, Insects, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, NRA

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-4 when 3 oceans are out and you want plant production or a cheap plant tag.

---

### Nuclear Power (#045) — 62/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 10+3=13 MC (steel payable) + 2 MC-prod lost (10). Total ~23 MC gen 1. Value: 3 energy-prod (22.5). Net ~-0.5 MC gen 1, better mid-game.

**Почему C (62):** Good when you need lots of energy (colonies trading, oxygen bumpers, Physics Complex). The -2 MC-prod hurts early but matters less mid-late game. benbever notes mid-game effective cost is only ~19 MC for 3 energy. Power+Building tags are useful. Preferred: Peroxide Power for smaller needs.

**Синергии:** Colonies (trading), Strip Mine, AI Central, Physics Complex, Ironworks/Steelworks

**Когда брать:** When you specifically need 3 energy production. With colonies it's good in opening hand. Without specific energy needs, skip.

---

### Permafrost Extraction (#191) — 62/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: -8°C | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 8+3=11 MC. Value: 1 ocean (TR 7-7.4 + placement bonus 2-6). Total ~9-13 MC. No tags = penalty (-3 to -5). Req: -8C.

**Почему C (62):** Cheap ocean that's 7 MC less than SP, which is good value. But the -8C requirement means it's mid-game at earliest, and no tags means penalty. Risk of oceans being maxed by the time temperature reaches -8C. shai_aus rates it fine with manageable requirement. Better with event rebates (IC, Media Group).

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Media Group, Arctic Algae, Lakefront Resorts, Inventrix

**Когда брать:** When temperature is near -8C and oceans remain. Don't speculate early. Good as mid-game free draw.

---

### Rad-Chem Factory (#205) — 62/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11 MC total (8+3) + 1 energy prod (~7.5 MC) = effective ~18.5 MC for 2 TR (~14.8 MC). Slight overpay but Building tag + steel payable helps. Late game: 11 MC for 2 VP = 5.5 MC/VP.

**Почему C (62):** Decent late-game VP card when you have excess energy. icehawk84 calls it 'Bad-chem Factory' but acknowledges it is not terrible with steel. The -1 energy prod makes early play expensive. Best as last-gen steel dump with spare energy. Building tag helps for milestones.

**Синергии:** Steel corps, Excess energy production, Terraformer milestone, Colonies (spare energy)

**Когда брать:** Late game when you have excess energy production and steel. Not worth drafting early.

---

### Rego Plastics (#X10) — 62/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13 MC total (10+3) for steel +1 value + 1 VP + Building tag. Need to spend ~8 steel after playing to break even. With 2+ steel prod, effectively 2 MC-prod equivalent.

**Почему C (62):** Decent with significant steel production, but steel is often hard to spend on building cards late game. shai_aus says it is 'pretty severely overrated' for most games. 1 VP provides floor value. Building tag helps. Worse than Advanced Alloys. Best with IC opening hand or high steel production.

**Синергии:** IC (20 steel), Mining Guild, Steel production preludes, Ceres colony, Building-heavy strategies

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ steel production and many building cards to play. Late game it is just 1 VP.

---

### Shuttles (#166) — 62/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Требования: 5% oxygen | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13 MC total (10+3) + 1 energy prod (~7.5 MC) = effective ~20.5 MC for 2 MC-prod (~10 MC) + 2 MC space discount/card + 1 VP + Space tag. Requires 5% O2.

**Почему C (62):** Mid-game engine card that loses to the timing problem: by 5% O2, MC production matters less. -1 energy is painful. icehawk84 says 'low impact' and prefers Space Station. shai_aus is skeptical. The space discount is decent for heavy space strategies but the card comes online too late for the production to matter much.

**Синергии:** Space-heavy engine, Mass Converter/Quantum Extractor, Phobolog

**Когда брать:** Mid-game for space engine builders with excess energy. Not a high priority card.

---

### Small Asteroid (#209) — 62/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 13 MC total (10+3) for 1 temp TR (~7-7.4 MC) + remove 2 plants + Space tag. Ti payable. Slightly better than SP asteroid (14 MC). Minor take-that in 3P.

**Почему C (62):** Cheap temperature raise with Space tag, titanium payable. Slightly better than Standard Project. Plant removal is minor in 3P (take-that penalty applies weakly). COTD consensus: 'fine but not exciting.' Better with Optimal Aerobraking. Low-impact, reliable filler card.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, IC/Media Group, Space discounts, Temperature bonuses

**Когда брать:** When you need temperature TR and have titanium or space discounts. Decent filler.

---

### Solarnet (#245) — 62/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: 1 Venus tag / 1 Earth tag / 1 Jovian tag | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 10 MC total (7+3) for 2 cards (~8 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC). No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Req: Venus+Earth+Jovian tags. Total value ~13 MC but requires triple planetary requirement.

**Почему C (62):** Decent card draw + VP but the triple planetary requirement (Venus+Earth+Jovian) is restrictive and hard to meet early when card draw matters most. No tags is a significant penalty. Compared unfavorably to Research (4 MC more but double science tag and no requirements). shai_aus: 'slightly better but harder to play SF Memorial.'

**Синергии:** Multi-tag strategies, Diversifier milestone, Forecaster award

**Когда брать:** Only when you already meet Venus+Earth+Jovian requirements. Not worth forcing.

---

### Subterranean Reservoir (#127) — 62/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for 1 ocean (1 TR = 7 MC + placement bonus ~2-4 MC). SP ocean costs 18 MC, saving 4 MC. No tags (event, but no tag value). No-tag penalty applies partially.

**Почему C (62):** A cheaper ocean - simple and functional. benbever notes the 4 MC savings plus placement bonuses. No tags is a downside, but event tag counts for Legend/Media Group. icehawk84 says 'usually not too excited unless I have event rebates.' Decent but not exciting.

**Синергии:** Arctic Algae, Lakefront Resorts, IC rebate, Media Group, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** When you need an ocean and have MC but no better options. Good for ocean-walking combos.

---

### Venus Governor (#255) — 62/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: 2 Venus tags | Теги: Venus, Venus | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for 2 MC-prod (10-12 MC) + 2 Venus tags (~4-5 MC). Req 2 Venus tags. At 7 MC for 2 MC-prod, that's 3.5 MC/prod - excellent if played gen 1. Venuphile award clincher.

**Почему C (62):** Sponsors but cheaper and with Venus tags instead of Earth. benbever notes it's great value if played early. The 2 Venus tag requirement limits early play in most games, but Morning Star Inc and Venus Waystation make it free. FieldMouse007 calls it 'mediocre' because buying it doubles the cost and Venus tags have less value than Earth.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Venus Waystation, Venuphile award, Gyropolis, Sulphur Exports

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 if you already have 2 Venus tags. Clinches Venuphile. With discounts it's essentially free value.

---

### Venus Trade Hub (#P90) — 62/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 2 Venus tags | Теги: Venus, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2 | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC (ti-payable) for effect (likely trade bonus) + 1 VP + Venus+Space tags. No COTD data. Req 2 Venus tags. Comparable to other Venus combo enablers.

**Почему C (62):** No COTD data available. Based on cost structure: 15 MC ti-payable for 1 VP + effect + Venus+Space tags. The 2 Venus tag requirement limits use. With Colonies compatibility, likely a trade-enhancing effect. The Venus+Space dual tag helps with Venuphile and ti-payment. Mid-tier Venus support card.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, Morning Star Inc, Venus Waystation, Venuphile award, Titanium

**Когда брать:** When playing Venus + Colonies combo and have 2+ Venus tags. Ti-payable makes it accessible.

### Casinos (#X72) — 62/C

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 1 city | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 5+3=8 MC + energy-prod (~7 MC) = 15 MC effective. 4 MC-prod (20-24 MC gen 1-2). Requires 1 city. Building tag (steel). Net +5-9 MC gen 1-2. Break-even gen 3.

**Почему C (62):** Strong MC-production rate at 3.75 MC/prod effective cost, but two hard requirements: city already placed AND energy production to sacrifice. The Building tag for steel payability helps. In practice, having a city + energy by gen 2-3 in 3P/WGT is not guaranteed. When the requirements are met early, the 4 MC-prod is excellent. Late game (gen 5+) the MC-prod cannot compound enough. The energy-prod cost is the main pain point. No VP hurts.

**Синергии:** Manutech, Thorgate, City-placing corps, Steel production

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-3 with city already placed and energy-prod available. Steel-payable via Building tag. Skip without city or if gen 4+.

---

### Corporate Stronghold (#182) — 62/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: -2

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC + energy-prod (~7 MC) = 21 MC effective. City tile (adjacency 2-4 MC) + 3 MC-prod (15-18 MC gen 1-2) - 2 VP (10 MC). City+Building tags (steel). Net -3 to +1 MC gen 1. Cheapest city option.

**Почему C (62):** Cheapest city card in the game with decent 3 MC-prod. City+Building tags provide steel payability. The -2 VP is the main penalty, making it a purely economic play. In 3P/WGT the city tile adjacency to greeneries can partially offset the -2 VP. Best as gen 1 city placement when MC-prod compounds over 7-8 gens (21-24 MC return). The energy-prod cost is standard. Compared to Open City (4 MC-prod, +1 VP but 23 MC), this trades VP for cheaper upfront cost and earlier playability.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Manutech, Mayor milestone, Steel production, Early economy

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 as cheapest city + MC-prod dump. Steel-payable priority. Accept -2 VP trade for early economy. Skip gen 4+ or if VP matters more than economy.

### Floating Refinery (#P73) — 62/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for action: add 1 floater per Venus tag. Venus tag (2-3 MC). With 3 Venus tags = 3 floaters/gen. Spend 2 floaters = 1 Venus raise + 1 TR? No -- just accumulates for VP via Floating Habs. Slow engine.

**Почему C (62):** Cheap Venus floater generator that scales with Venus tag count. At 10 MC it is affordable but the value depends entirely on floater payoffs. Without Floating Habs, Dirigibles, or other floater-to-value converters, the floaters sit idle. With 3+ Venus tags the floater generation is decent (3/gen). Venus tag adds to count. The card is a support piece, not a standalone -- it needs synergy to justify the slot. In Venus-heavy games with payoff targets it is solid; without them it is a wasted card slot.

**Синергии:** Floating Habs, Dirigibles, Celestic, Aphrodite, Stratospheric Birds

**Когда брать:** When running Venus floater strategy with 2+ Venus tags and floater payoff targets. Skip without Floating Habs or Dirigibles. Venus tag is floor value.

### Media Archives (#107) — 61/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** Cost 8+3=11 MC. Value: 1 MC per event ever played. In 3P by late game ~12-18 events = 12-18 MC. Net +1-7 MC. Earth tag (2-3).

**Почему C (61):** Late-game money bomb that's hard to time well. In 3P, events accumulate reasonably but you can't play this early (not enough events). icehawk84 says it's almost always strong late in 3P+. The Earth tag adds value. But it occupies hand space while providing zero value until played. Inferior to Investment Loan in flexibility.

**Синергии:** Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Event-heavy strategies

**Когда брать:** Mid-to-late game when ~15+ events have been played. Don't speculate on it early unless cash is abundant.

---

### Spin-Inducing Asteroid (#246) — 61/C

Стоимость: 16 MC | Требования: Max 10% Venus | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 19 MC total (16+3) for 2 Venus TR (~14.8 MC). Ti payable. Space event tag. Max 10% Venus requirement limits timing. Slight overpay.

**Почему C (61):** Previously evaluated at 61/C in calibration data. 2 Venus TR for 19 MC is slightly overpriced. Max 10% Venus limits to early game. Space event tag allows titanium payment and event rebates. Better with Venus payoffs (Venusian Animals, Strato Birds). icehawk84 says 'not the worst if you have Venus payoffs.'

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Venus payoff cards, Space/event discounts, Terraforming Deal

**Когда брать:** Early game when Venus is low and you have Venus strategy cards. With discounts it becomes efficient.

---

### Symbiotic Fungus (#133) — 61/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: -14°C | Теги: Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for action: add 1 microbe to any card. At 1/2 VP per microbe (Ants, Decomposers): 0.5 VP/gen = 2.5 MC/gen. Microbe tag worth ~1-2 MC. Req -14C.

**Почему C (61):** Cheap and can add meaningful VP to microbe cards over several gens. icehawk84 notes for 2 MC more you could play Small Animals which gives 0.5 VP/gen without a target. FieldMouse007 says 'as long as it gives 2+ points, it's very good.' The -14C requirement delays deployment. Needs good microbe targets to shine.

**Синергии:** Ants, GHG Producing Bacteria, Decomposers, Regolith Eaters, Sulphur-Eating Bacteria

**Когда брать:** When you have a microbe VP card to feed. Draft speculatively even without one - cheap enough to gamble on finding a target.

---

### Weather Balloons (#033) — 61/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for Science tag (3-5 MC) + draw 1 card (3 MC) + action: add floater. 1 VP potential if used as floater target. Total value ~8-10 MC from immediate effects. Net -4 to -6 MC upfront, but action provides ongoing floater value.

**Почему C (61):** Science tag with card draw and floater action. The 14 MC upfront for Science tag + 1 card is overpriced compared to Invention Contest (3 MC for 1 of 3 cards). The floater action adds slow value if used as floater target for other cards. Main value is the Science tag for AI Central, Mars University, Olympus Conference triggers. Without Science tag needs, this is too expensive. The floater accumulation can provide VP via Floating Habs count but this is slow and conditional.

**Синергии:** Mars University, Olympus Conference, Science tag requirements, Floating Habs

**Когда брать:** When you need a Science tag and the card draw + floater action add marginal value. Skip without Science tag synergies -- too expensive for the raw value.

### Spin-inducing Asteroid (#?) — 61/C

Стоимость: ? MC | Теги: — | Тип: ? | Дополнение: ?

**Экономика:** 2 Venus TR за 19 MC. Ti payable.

**Почему C (61):** 2 Venus TR. Ti payable снижает cost. Event тег.

**Синергии:** Venus strategy, Ti production

**Когда брать:** Venus + ti.

### Advertising (#X13) — 60/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for Earth tag (2-3 MC) + effect. Need 2 triggers (20+ MC cards) for 10 MC production value. Break-even requires 2 expensive cards played early.

**Почему C (60):** Cheap Earth tag with a conditional effect. The trigger (playing 20+ MC cards) is achievable but not guaranteed -- only ~17% of cards cost 20+. Need at least 2 triggers to be worth it. Good with Credicor and Point Luna. Mostly a cheap Earth tag enabler rather than a strong economy card. In 3P/WGT the game is shorter, making triggers harder to accumulate.

**Синергии:** Credicor, Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Luna Metropolis

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 with 2+ expensive cards in hand and/or Point Luna/Credicor. Otherwise treat as a cheap Earth tag.

---

### Beam From A Thorium Asteroid (#058) — 60/C

Стоимость: 32 MC | Требования: 1 Jovian tag | Теги: Jovian, Space, Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 32+3=35 MC for 3 heat-prod (12 MC) + 3 energy-prod (22.5 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Jovian+Space+Power tags (~6-8 MC). Value ~45 MC. Good if played early. Ti-payable.

**Почему C (60):** Great production value on paper (45 MC worth of stuff), but the 35 MC upfront cost and Jovian tag requirement make it hard to deploy early when the production matters most. With Colonies, 3 energy-prod is very useful for trading. With ti-payment the effective cost drops significantly. But the Jovian requirement means you need Saturn Systems, a Jovian prelude, or another expensive Jovian card first. Situationally strong, often stranded in hand.

**Синергии:** Saturn Systems, Colonies (trading), Phobolog, Hellas milestones, Jovian multipliers

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with Saturn Systems or Jovian prelude + titanium. Excellent with Colonies for energy. Skip without Jovian tag.

---

### Deuterium Export (#221) — 60/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Space, Venus, Power | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC cost. Action: 1 floater per gen, convert to energy-prod. Gives ~1 energy-prod every 2 gens = ~3.75 MC/gen average. Triple tag value (Space+Venus+Power) ~5 MC.

**Почему C (60):** Slow energy production generator with 3 useful tags. On its own, getting energy production every other gen is underwhelming. But with Celestic/Stormcraft for floaters every gen, it becomes solid. The triple tag is genuinely valuable for Diversifier and Aridor. Per icehawk84, it can be very good with Celestic specifically; otherwise mostly ignorable.

**Синергии:** Celestic, Stormcraft, Titan colony, Floater Technology, Dirigibles

**Когда брать:** With floater-generating corporations or when you need the triple tag for Diversifier. Otherwise low priority.

---

### GHG Import From Venus (#228) — 60/C

Стоимость: 23 MC | Теги: Space, Venus | Тип: event | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 23 MC (ti payable) + 3 MC card = 26 MC cost. Returns: 1 Venus TR (~7.2 MC) + 3 heat-prod (~12 MC gen1) + Space+Venus+Event tags (~5 MC). Total ~24.2 MC.

**Почему C (60):** Overpriced bundle of Venus TR and heat production. At 26 MC for ~24 MC value, it's slightly below cost even at gen 1 valuations. The triple tag (Space+Venus+Event) is the best feature. Ti payability helps with Phobolog. Per community assessment, it's rarely exciting — you're paying premium for Venus you might not want and heat production that's mediocre. Better with Aphrodite or Terraforming Deal for Venus TR bonus.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Aphrodite, Terraforming Deal, Helion, Thermalist award

**Когда брать:** Early game with titanium to spend and Venus TR synergies. Skip if you don't benefit from Venus.

---

### Hi-Tech Lab (#X04) — 60/C

Стоимость: 17 MC | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 17 MC + 3 MC card = 20 MC. 1 VP. Action: spend N energy to look at N cards, keep 1. Each use costs energy resources (~1.5 MC each). Net card quality improvement worth ~2-3 MC per use above base.

**Почему C (60):** Expensive for what it does. The action is essentially paying energy to get a curated card draw, but you only keep 1 card regardless of how many you spend. Science + Building tags are good, and 1 VP helps, but 20 MC upfront is steep. Works best with excess energy production from science engines but those situations are uncommon in 8-gen games.

**Синергии:** Callisto colony, Energy Market, Mars University, AI Central

**Когда брать:** When you have strong energy production and need card filtering. Science engine support piece. Pass in most situations.

---

### Immigrant City (#200) — 60/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: City, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 13 MC + 3 MC card + 7.5 MC (1 energy prod) + 10 MC (2 MC-prod loss) = ~33.5 MC. City tile worth ~2 VP. Effect: +1 MC-prod per city placed. Need 5+ cities to recover production loss.

**Почему C (60):** Classic noob trap when played early. The production hit is devastating in competitive 3P games where not enough cities are placed to justify it. Per icehawk84 stats, early play has a very bad win rate in 3P. However, as a late-game cheap city (steel payable, -2 MC-prod is irrelevant last gen) it's decent. Building + City tags are valuable.

**Синергии:** Tharsis Republic, Rover Construction, Standard Technology

**Когда брать:** Late game as a cheap city tile and steel dump. Do NOT play early in 3P despite the temptation.

---

### Import of Advanced GHG (#167) — 60/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 9 MC + 3 MC card = 12 MC for 2 heat prod (~8 MC gen 1). At 6 MC per heat prod, it's ok in gen 1. Earth+Space event tags enable heavy discounts.

**Почему C (60):** Fair-priced heat production card that improves dramatically with discounts. Earth+Space event tags open up the most discount possibilities in the game (Optimal Aerobraking, Media Group, IC, Earth Office, etc.). Without discounts it's merely average at 6 MC per heat prod. With 2-3 discounts it becomes good. Better in gen 1 when heat prod has full value.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Media Group, IC, Earth Office, Teractor

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when going for heat terraforming and have discount infrastructure. With Optimal Aerobraking it's excellent.

---

### Industrial Center (#123) — 60/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 4 MC + 3 MC card = 7 MC. Building tag. Tile placement adjacent to city. Action: spend 7 MC for 1 steel prod. Steel prod action is rarely worth it.

**Почему C (60):** Cheap tile placement that can grab placement bonuses and block opponent greenery spots. The steel production action is almost never worth using in 3P all-expansions where games are short. Primary value is as a cheap Building tag, tile placement for bonuses, and positional disruption. Good for Builder milestone. Teleport value near cities.

**Синергии:** Builder milestone, Mining Guild, Landlord award

**Когда брать:** When good placement bonuses are available near cities, or need Building tag for milestone. Don't count on the action.

---

### Martian Survey (#P38) — 60/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: Max 4% oxygen | Теги: Science | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 9+3=12 MC. Value: 2 cards (6-8) + 1 VP (5) + Science tag (3-5). Total ~14-18 MC. Decent but max 4% O2 limits timing.

**Почему C (60):** Overpriced for what it does without discounts. 12 MC for 2 blind draws + 1 VP is mediocre early game when you'd rather have production. The max 4% O2 requirement means it can only be played early. With rebates (IC, Media Group, Valley Trust) it becomes much better. Science+Event tags enable combos.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Media Group, Valley Trust, Mars University, Olympus Conference

**Когда брать:** When you have event/science rebates. Also good for Legend milestone. Don't speculate on it if O2 might spike early.

---

### Minority Refuge (#C26) — 60/C

Стоимость: 5 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** Cost 5+3=8 MC + 2 MC-prod lost (10). Total effective ~18 MC for a colony (SP costs 17). Space tag (1-2). Late game: -2 prod irrelevant.

**Почему C (60):** Early game it's slightly worse than SP colony due to MC-prod loss. But it's titanium-payable via Space tag and gets better late-game when the -2 MC-prod doesn't matter. Good for grabbing placement bonuses (Europa ocean, Miranda animal) cheaply in final gens. benbever provides detailed analysis of niche scenarios.

**Синергии:** Poseidon, Phobolog, Europa colony, Miranda colony, Space tag discounts

**Когда брать:** Late game for colony placement bonuses when -2 MC-prod is irrelevant. Early game only if securing a critical colony spot.

---

### Mohole Lake (#X27) — 60/C

Стоимость: 31 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 31+3=34 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 temp TR (10) + 1 ocean (14) + 3 plants (7.5) + action (microbe or animal). Total ~31.5 + action. Slightly negative base.

**Почему C (60):** Big, expensive card that does many things but none amazingly. The terraforming value roughly equals cost. The action is nice with GHG Bacteria or 1VP animals but requires additional cards. Steel-payable is a big plus. COTD consensus: it's okay but conflicted between terraforming and engine. Best as a steel dump with a microbe/animal target.

**Синергии:** GHG Producing Bacteria, Venusian Animals, Fish, Mining Guild, Ceres colony

**Когда брать:** With excess steel AND a microbe/animal target for the action. Don't play just for the terraforming.

### Omnicourt (#241) — 60/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: 1 Venus tag / 1 Earth tag / 1 Jovian tag | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** Cost 11+3=14 MC (steel payable). Value: 2 TR (14.8) + Building tag (1-2). Total ~16 MC. Net ~+2 MC. Req: Venus+Earth+Jovian tags.

**Почему C (60):** 2 TR for 14 MC steel-payable is decent. The triple planetary tag requirement limits when you can play it. icehawk84 rates it what Release of Inert Gases should have been. FieldMouse007 calls it mediocre. As a steel dump with tags already met, it's fine. Not worth bending strategy for.

**Синергии:** Steel-heavy strategies, Mining Guild, Builder milestone, Terraformer milestone

**Когда брать:** When you naturally have Venus+Earth+Jovian tags and excess steel. Late-game steel dump for TR.

---

### Political Alliance (#X09) — 60/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: Party leader: 2 | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** Cost 4+3=7 MC. Value: 1 TR (7-7.4). No tags = penalty (-3 to -5). Req: 2 party leaders. Net ~-2 to -5 MC with tag penalty.

**Почему C (60):** Cheap TR card that's decent when the requirement is met. No tags is a penalty. benbever rates it good, noting 2 party leaders isn't hard in low player counts. It's a useful event for Legend milestone. shai_aus finds it boring but playable. The Turmoil requirement limits availability. Overall a filler card with narrow upside.

**Синергии:** Media Group, Interplanetary Cinematics, Legend milestone, Turmoil influence strategies

**Когда брать:** When you have 2 party leaders and need cheap TR. Good for Legend milestone. Low priority in draft.

---

### Power Supply Consortium (#160) — 60/C

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 2 Power tags | Теги: Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 8 MC total (5+3) for 1 energy prod. Fair price, but requires 2 Power tags (hard to meet early). Take-that component hurts in 3P format.

**Почему C (60):** The attack is meaningful but the 2 Power tag requirement is restrictive and often hard to fulfill when you most need it. In 3P, stealing energy helps the third player. icehawk84 notes Energy Tapping is slightly better due to no requirement. Decent but situational.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Wild tag cards, Power tag preludes, Colonies (deny trading energy)

**Когда брать:** When you already have 2 Power tags and can disrupt an opponent's plans. Less useful in 3P than 2P.

---

### Red Appeasement (#P80) — 60/C

Стоимость: 0 MC | Требования: Reds ruling | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 3 MC total (0+3) for 2 MC-prod (~10-12 MC early). Requires Reds ruling or 2 delegates + no other player passed. Forces you to pass immediately.

**Почему C (60):** Excellent efficiency when it works - 3 MC for 2 MC-prod is outstanding. But the requirement is very restrictive: Reds ruling is uncommon, and 'no other player passed' limits timing. Passing immediately is a significant cost. No tags penalty. benbever rates it well but acknowledges it is hard to trigger.

**Синергии:** Reds political strategy, Pristar, Engine builders with low TR, Media Group

**Когда брать:** When Reds are ruling and you are first to act. Very niche but powerful when conditions align.

---

### Solar Probe (#C37) — 60/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Space, Science | Тип: event | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12 MC total (9+3) for X cards (1 per 3 science tags including this) + 1 VP + Space+Science event tags. Ti payable. With 5 tags: 2 cards. With 8: 3 cards.

**Почему C (60):** Expensive for card draw unless you have many science tags. icehawk84 says 'event tag really hurts - below 5 tags it is worse than Lagrange Observatory.' Krazyguy75 agrees it is overpriced. At 5+ science tags it becomes decent. 1 VP + event with Space tag means discounts/rebates can help. C-tier for the average case.

**Синергии:** Mass Converter/Warp Drive (space discounts), Mars University, Optimal Aerobraking, Heavy science engine

**Когда брать:** Late game with 5+ science tags and space discounts. Not worth forcing.

---

### Soletta (#203) — 60/C

Стоимость: 35 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 38 MC total (35+3) for 7 heat prod (~42 MC gen 1). Ti payable. 5.43 MC per heat prod. Space tag. Huge investment for heat only.

**Почему C (60):** Classic gen 1 rush card that has been somewhat replaced by the cheaper Solar Reflectors. 38 MC is nearly all of gen 1 budget. shai_aus says 'value drops steeply after gen 1-2.' benbever notes it is 'a few MC too expensive.' The 7 heat prod guarantees 1 temp/gen but leaves you with no other economy. Better in 2P where you control game pace more.

**Синергии:** Phobolog (ti payment), Advanced Alloys, Helion, Insulation (convert to MC-prod), Thermalist

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 only with titanium to pay. Commits you to rush strategy. Otherwise skip.

---

### Sponsored Mohole (#T13) — 60/C

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: Kelvinists ruling | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 8 MC total (5+3) for 2 heat prod (~8-12 MC). Req: Kelvinists ruling or 2 delegates. Building tag. Steel payable. 4 MC per heat prod is best rate in the game.

**Почему C (60):** Cheapest heat production in the game at 4 MC per prod. But Kelvinists requirement is restrictive. Krazyguy75 argues pushing Kelvinists lets opponents benefit from the ruling policy too. Building tag and steel payability help. benbever notes the 2 MC kickback when Kelvinists come to power. Good when Kelvinists align with your strategy naturally, bad when forced.

**Синергии:** Kelvinists political strategy, Heat/rush strategy, Builder milestone, Colonies (Kelvinists energy)

**Когда брать:** When Kelvinists are already in power or you want them in power anyway. Do not force Kelvinists just for this.

---

### Venus Allies (#P87) — 60/C

Стоимость: 30 MC | Теги: Venus, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude 2 | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 30+3=33 MC (ti-payable) for 2 Venus TR (18 MC) + 4 MC per colony + 2 VP (10 MC) + Venus+Space tags (~3-4 MC). At 2 colonies: 33-8=25 MC for 4 VP, decent. At 3: 33-12=21 MC for 4 VP, good.

**Почему C (60):** No key commenter COTD data. With 2+ colonies it's a reasonable VP card. Ti-payable with Space tag helps. The 2 Venus TR raises the track which can help Venus requirements. At 3 colonies, 21 MC for 4 VP + 2 Venus TR is solid. Late game VP card that works with colony + Venus combo strategy.

**Синергии:** Multiple colonies, Titanium, Venus requirements, Venuphile award, Aphrodite

**Когда брать:** Late game with 2+ colonies and ti to pay. Better in Venus-heavy games. Skip without colonies.

---

### Corroder Suits (#219) — 59/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for 2 MC-prod (10 MC) + Venus tag (2-3 MC) + 1 Venus resource (~1-5 MC depending on target). Total ~13-18 MC.

**Почему C (59):** Essentially Sponsors +2 MC cost with a Venus tag instead of Earth tag and a bonus Venus resource. The Venus tag is less valuable than Earth tag in most games (fewer Venus synergies). The Venus resource varies from worthless (no target) to strong (1 VP animal). Early play for MC-prod is decent, late play for VP resource is decent, but the card is conflicted -- early play means no good resource target, late play means MC-prod is less valuable.

**Синергии:** Venuphile award, Venusian Animals, Stratospheric Birds, Venus Waystation, Diversifier milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 for MC-prod if Venus tag helps with award/milestone. Late game if you have a 1-VP Venus animal.

---

### Pets (#172) — 59/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Earth, Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** Cost 10+3=13 MC. Value: 1 VP per 2 animals. With 6-8 cities total = 3-4 VP (15-20 MC). Earth+Animal tags (3-5). Total ~18-25 MC over full game. Pure VP card.

**Почему C (59):** Pure VP card that needs early play for maximum value but conflicts with early-game economy needs. In 3P all-expansions, cities are moderate (5-8 total). shai_aus rates it medium -- good in city-heavy games, mediocre otherwise. The 1VP/2 animals ratio is worse than 1VP/1 animal cards. Earth+Animal tags have synergy value. Meat Industry combo is strong.

**Синергии:** Meat Industry, Tharsis Republic, Viral Enhancers, Arklight, Ecological Zone

**Когда брать:** When you expect 6+ cities and can play gen 1-2. With Meat Industry it becomes much better. Otherwise low priority.

---

### Aqueduct Systems (#X50) — 58/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 1 city / 1 oceans | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC (in steel) for 3 Building cards (9-12 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Building tag (1-2 MC). Total ~15-19 MC. Good if requirement met.

**Почему C (58):** 3 Building card draw + 1 VP + Building tag for 12 MC in steel is good value, but the requirement (city adjacent to ocean) is awkward. You typically do not want cities near oceans, and building a city just for this is expensive. If the requirement happens to be met, the card is good. Building cards are hit-or-miss in quality. Niche but acceptable when stars align.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Early Settlement prelude, Capital, Steel colony

**Когда брать:** Only when you already have a city next to an ocean and have steel to spend. Do not build around this card.

---

### Bio Printing Facility (#X36) — 58/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for Building tag (1-2 MC) + action: 2 energy -> 2 plants or 1 animal. With 1VP animal: ~5 MC/action. With plants: ~2 MC/action (plants vs heat).

**Почему C (58):** Cheap card with a flexible action, but requires energy production to function. The animal placement mode is strong with 1-VP-per-animal cards (Birds, Fish, Livestock) -- effectively converting 2 energy to 1 VP. The plant mode is mediocre since energy already converts to heat. Best as an animal feeder when you have excess energy from Mass Converter/Quantum Extractor. Without energy, useless.

**Синергии:** Birds, Fish, Livestock, Mass Converter, Quantum Extractor

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ excess energy-prod AND a 1-VP animal card. Otherwise low priority.

---

### Deep Well Heating (#003) — 58/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 13 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 16 MC cost. Returns: 1 TR (~7.2 MC) + 1 energy-prod (~7.5 MC) + Power+Building tags (~3 MC). Total ~17.7 MC value. Tiny bundle discount.

**Почему C (58):** Mediocre card that does two things you rarely need together. Per icehawk84, it's fair value but rarely what you want — if you need energy you pay for temperature you don't need, and vice versa. Per FieldMouse007, best use is holding it for later as a steel dump when you need a surprise heat/energy boost. The 2 tags (Power+Building) are its best feature.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Thorgate, Fusion Power, Standard Technology, Steelworks

**Когда брать:** When you have steel to dump and need both energy production and temperature advancement. Good early with steel resources.

---

### Floating Habs (#225) — 58/C

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 5 MC + 3 MC card = 8 MC cost. Action: spend 2 MC to add floater here OR add floater to any card. 1 VP per 2 floaters. 2 Science tag req. Venus tag.

**Почему C (58):** Best VP-per-floater ratio (1 per 2), but on its own 2 MC per floater means 4 MC per VP which isn't great with an 8 MC investment. Per benbever, best use is as a floater distributor to other cards where floaters are worth more. The 2 Science tag requirement limits accessibility. Good with Titan colony for bulk floater dumps. Per community, not a high priority on its own but good in floater engines.

**Синергии:** Titan colony, Dirigibles, Hydrogen to Venus, Floater Technology, Hoverlord milestone

**Когда брать:** Mid game with Titan colony or 2+ floater dispensers. Good floater dump target for Hoverlord.

### Fueled Generators (#100) — 58/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 1 MC + 3 MC card = 4 MC cost. Net effect: -1 MC-prod (~-5 MC gen1) + 1 energy-prod (~7.5 MC gen1). Net gain: ~2.5 MC value gen1. Power+Building tags (~3 MC).

**Почему C (58):** Cheapest energy production in the game with useful dual tags. Per shai_aus, going on upfront cost it's the cheapest energy and cheapest building — if either matters, it's decent. Per ad_hocNC, it's a bad deal but energy 'now' has value. The -1 MC production hurts long-term but if you need immediate energy for cities, trading, or card effects, the 4 MC upfront cost is hard to beat. Better than SP Power Plant at 11 MC.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, GHG Factories, Fusion Power requirement, Builder milestone, city cards

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 when you urgently need energy production for another card and have no better energy source.

---

### Gyropolis (#230) — 58/C

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 20 MC + 14 MC (2 energy prod) + 3 MC card = ~37 MC total. Need 5+ Earth/Venus tags for 5+ MC-prod to break even. City worth ~2 VP. At 5 tags: 25 MC prod value + 10 MC city = 35 MC, barely even.

**Почему C (58):** Very expensive city that requires significant Earth/Venus tag investment to justify. In 3P with all expansions, games are ~8 gen so production payoff window is narrow. Better in 2P with more gens. Steel payable is nice but energy cost hurts with Colonies trading.

**Синергии:** Robotic Workforce, Point Luna, Teractor, Earth Office, Advanced Alloys

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game steel dump when you have 5+ Earth/Venus tags and excess energy production. Good for Banker award snipe.

---

### Imported GHG (#162) — 58/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 7 MC + 3 MC card = 10 MC for 1 heat prod (~4-6 MC) + 3 heat (~3.75 MC) = ~8-10 MC value. Earth+Space event tags. Barely breaks even without discounts.

**Почему C (58):** Marginal value on its own but excellent with discount infrastructure. The Earth+Space event triple-tag combo enables massive discounts. With Optimal Aerobraking alone it becomes profitable. The 3 instant heat can be clutch for sniping a temperature bonus. Low impact overall but very cheap and flexible.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Media Group, IC, Earth Office, Point Luna

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ discount/rebate cards active. With Optimal Aerobraking, almost always play. Without discounts, it's marginal.

---

### Mineral Deposit (#062) — 58/C

Стоимость: 5 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** Cost 5+3=8 MC. Value: 5 steel (10 MC). Net +2 MC. No tags = penalty (-3 to -5). Event for Legend. Better with rebates.

**Почему C (58):** Small but positive value if you can spend the steel. The no-tag penalty hurts significantly. With IC/Media Group rebates it becomes good. benbever notes it's good for Legend milestone and Miner award. Low impact but rarely bad. Not worth a high draft pick.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Media Group, Advanced Alloys, Rego Plastics, Electro Catapult

**Когда брать:** When you have event rebates or need steel for specific plays. Low draft priority. Good as free draw.

### New Holland (#X-2) — 58/C

Стоимость: 20 MC | Требования: 4 cities | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 20+3=23 MC (steel payable). Value: 3 MC-prod (15-18) + City (placement VP) + City+Building tags (2-3). Req: 4 cities on Mars. Net ~-5 to -2.

**Почему C (58):** Interesting concept but 4 cities on Mars requirement is very difficult to meet in 3P before good spots are gone. No COTD data available. The 3 MC-prod is decent and it's steel payable. Placing a city on an ocean tile is unique but the requirement severely limits playability. Niche promo card.

**Синергии:** Tharsis Republic, Mayor milestone, City-heavy strategies, Capital

**Когда брать:** Only when 4+ cities exist on Mars AND good ocean spots remain for city placement. Very rare scenario.

---

### Nitrogen from Titan (#C28) — 58/C

Стоимость: 25 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 25+3=28 MC (ti payable). Value: 2 TR (14.8) + 1 VP (5) + 2 floaters (~3) + Jovian+Space tags (4-7). Total ~27-30 MC. Break-even with tags.

**Почему C (58):** A typical 'yet another Jovian' card. In isolation it's mediocre, but with multipliers and ti-discounts it becomes decent. The floaters on a Jovian card can add value (Jovian Lanterns for +1 VP). Krazyguy75 says at best it's good, never bad. Requires synergy to shine. Ti-payable helps in late game.

**Синергии:** Jovian multipliers, Titan Floating Launch-pad, Phobolog, Jovian Lanterns, Space tag discounts

**Когда брать:** Late game with Jovian multipliers and titanium to spend. Low priority without specific synergy.

---

### PR Office (#T09) — 58/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: Unity ruling | Теги: Earth | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** Cost 7+3=10 MC. Value: 1 TR (7-7.4) + 1 MC per Earth tag + Earth tag (2-3). Req: Unity ruling/2 delegates. At 3 Earth tags = 3 MC refund. Net ~0-3 MC.

**Почему C (58):** Fairly priced TR with Earth tag refund. At 1 Earth tag (this one), it's 10 MC for 1 TR + 1 MC which is mediocre. With 4+ Earth tags it becomes good value. The Unity party requirement is manageable but limits flexibility. COTD has no key commenter data. A filler Turmoil card.

**Синергии:** Teractor, Point Luna, Earth Office, Earth tag strategies, Unity party

**Когда брать:** With 3+ Earth tags when Unity is ruling. Otherwise skip.

---

### Recruitment (#T11) — 58/C

Стоимость: 2 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 5 MC total (2+3) for replacing a neutral delegate with yours. Same cost as placing a delegate but more powerful (removes neutral). No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему C (58):** Cheap political card that is strictly better than placing a delegate in certain situations. Can steal party leadership surprise. No tags hurts. Event tag useless. Very situational - depends on Turmoil board state. In 3P it can be powerful for stealing Chairman.

**Синергии:** Turmoil strategies, IC/Media Group (event discounts), Chairman-dependent cards

**Когда брать:** When Turmoil is in play and you need to contest party leadership. Hold for optimal timing.

---

### Satellites (#175) — 58/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 13 MC total (10+3) for X MC-prod (1 per space tag including this). Space tag. Event space tags don't count. Need 3+ space tags for decent value.

**Почему C (58):** Needs many non-event space tags to be worthwhile, which is difficult. shai_aus notes event space tags do not count, making it much weaker. Best for Banker award sniping. With 4+ space tags it gives 4+ MC-prod for 13 MC which is decent. Very niche and strategy-dependent.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Space tag heavy strategies, Banker award, Saturn Systems

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ non-event space tags played. Can swing Banker award. Otherwise skip.

---

### Trans-Neptune Probe (#084) — 58/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Science, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC (ti-payable) for 1 VP (5 MC) + Science+Space tags (~5-7 MC). With ti: ~3-5 MC effective cost. Enables science requirements.

**Почему C (58):** Boring but functional. icehawk84 notes it's 'a cheap tag to unlock science payoffs.' FieldMouse007 calls it 'overpriced 1pt unless you have too much titanium.' The dual Science+Space tag is genuinely useful for requirements, making this mostly a tag enabler with a small VP bonus. Best when ti is available.

**Синергии:** Anti-Gravity Technology, AI Central, Mass Converter, Mars University, Titanium dump

**Когда брать:** When you need a science tag for requirements and have titanium to spend. Late game VP dump. Not a priority pick.

---

### Tropical Resort (#098) — 58/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC (steel-payable) for -2 heat-prod + 3 MC-prod + 2 VP. If heat-prod has no remaining value: 16 MC for 3 MC-prod (barely used) + 2 VP (10 MC). Building tag ~1-2 MC.

**Почему C (58):** Primarily a late-game VP card when temperature is maxed and heat production is worthless. benbever confirms 'definitely a late game card - use when you can't use your heat anymore.' 16 MC for 2 VP is below average but steel-payable helps. The 3 MC-prod helps with Banker. Not worth early play.

**Синергии:** Banker award, Steel dump, Temperature maxed, Helion, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Last gen or second to last when temperature is maxed and you have heat-prod to sacrifice. Steel-payable makes it cheaper.

---

### Water Import From Europa (#012) — 58/C

Стоимость: 25 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/Jovian tag

**Экономика:** 25+3=28 MC (ti-payable) for action: pay 12 MC (ti OK) for 1 ocean + 1 VP per Jovian tag. Jovian multiplier: at 4 tags = 4 VP (20 MC) + ocean action. Ocean at 12 MC vs SP 18 MC = 6 MC savings/use.

**Почему C (58):** One of 4 Jovian multipliers. benbever's detailed analysis shows the ocean action is decent (6 MC under SP, ti-payable) but the real value is VP scaling. shai_aus calls it 'probably the worst Jovian multiplier' but FieldMouse007 notes 5+ VP makes it decent. Hate-draft priority against Jovian players. Flexible timing: can play early for oceans or late for VP.

**Синергии:** Saturn Systems, Io Mining Industries, Terraforming Ganymede, Phobolog, Lakefront Resorts

**Когда брать:** In Jovian strategy for the multiplier VP. Hate-draft against Jovian players. Ocean action is bonus. Ti-payable is key.

---

### Airliners (#C01) — 58/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: {'floaters': 3, 'count': 3} | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for 2 MC-prod (10-12 MC gen 1) + 2 floaters (2-4 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC). Requires 3 floaters. No tags (-3 to -5 MC). Total value ~17-21 MC. Net +3 to +7 MC but req is the gate.

**Почему C (58):** Decent value if requirement is met -- 2 MC-prod + 2 floaters + VP for 14 MC. But the 3-floater requirement AND no tags both drag it down. You need a floater engine already running (Dirigibles, Aerial Mappers, etc.) to meet the requirement. No tags means zero synergy value. The 2 floaters added help floater engines but you already need floaters to play this. Circular dependency. Acquired Company gives similar MC-prod with an Earth tag for less cost. Only worth it in deep floater strategies.

**Синергии:** Dirigibles, Aerial Mappers, Floating Habs, Celestic, Floater strategies

**Когда брать:** Only with active floater engine providing 3+ floaters. The MC-prod + VP is decent payoff but no tags and requirement gate limit it. Skip without floater infrastructure.

---

### Martian Lumber Corp (#X60) — 58/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 2 greeneries | Теги: Building, Plant | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for 1 plant-prod (8 MC gen 1) + Building+Plant tags (3-4 MC) + effect: plants as 3 MC for Building. Requires 2 greeneries. Total value ~11-12 MC. Net +2 to +3 MC. But effect is a trap.

**Почему C (58):** The NRA enabler value (Building+Plant tags) is the real draw. 1 plant-prod for 9 MC is slightly below average. The effect (plants as 3 MC for Building cards) sounds good but is actually a trap -- spending plants delays greeneries which are more valuable. You are converting 8 plants (1 greenery = 1 TR + 1 VP = ~12 MC) into 24 MC of Building discount, which sounds better but only if you have huge plant-prod AND enough Building cards. The 2-greenery requirement also means mid-game play at earliest.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Insects, Building-heavy strategies, Plant-prod engines

**Когда брать:** For Building+Plant tag combo enabling NRA. Ignore the effect in most cases -- it is a trap. Best gen 3-4 with 2 greeneries already placed.

---

### ArchaeBacteria (#042) — 57/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: Max -18°C | Теги: Microbe | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for 1 plant-prod (8 MC gen 1). Microbe tag worth 1-2 MC. Max -18C easy to meet gen 1. 9 MC total, ~9-10 MC value. Fair.

**Почему C (57):** Cheapest plant production in the game at 9 MC total, but gives a Microbe tag instead of the more valuable Plant tag. The max -18C requirement is almost always met gen 1. Fair value as a gen 1 play to start greenery accumulation, but 1 plant-prod alone does little -- you need additional plant sources. The Microbe tag has niche synergy with Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen Rich Asteroid (needs plant tag instead), Decomposers, Advanced Ecosystems, Worms, Ecological Zone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 only, when you need cheap plant production and have no better options. The Microbe tag is less useful than Plant tag.

---

### Artificial Photosynthesis (#115) — 57/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for Science tag (3-5 MC) + 2 energy-prod (15 MC) or 1 plant-prod (8 MC). Energy mode: 7.5 MC/prod, slightly above average.

**Почему C (57):** Overpriced for production alone, but the Science tag adds value. 2 energy-prod for 15 MC (7.5 MC each) is acceptable but not good -- Geothermal Power and Solar Wind Power are better deals. The plant-prod option is terrible (15 MC for 1 plant-prod). Mainly played for the Science tag when you need energy production and a science requirement. Functional but uninspiring.

**Синергии:** Science requirement cards, Colonies (energy for trading), AI Central, Mass Converter

**Когда брать:** When you need a Science tag AND 2 energy-prod. Otherwise find cheaper energy or better Science tags.

---

### Giant Space Mirror (#083) — 57/C

Стоимость: 17 MC | Теги: Power, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 17 MC + 3 MC card = 20 MC cost. Returns: 3 energy-prod (~22.5 MC gen1) + Space tag (~2 MC). Total ~24.5 MC. Efficiency: 6.7 MC per energy-prod.

**Почему C (57):** Overpriced energy production. 20 MC for 3 energy-prod is better per-unit than SP Power Plant but the bulk cost is painful. Per benbever in other COTD threads, it's rarely worth playing unless you can pay significant portion in titanium. The Space tag enables ti payment which is the main draw. There are usually better energy sources available. Colonies make energy more valuable but 20 MC gen1 is a lot.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Energy Market, Colonies trading, Physics Complex, Equatorial Magnetizer

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with titanium to pay and immediate need for 3 energy (Colonies, multiple energy-dependent cards).

---

### Grass (#087) — 57/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: -16°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC cost. Returns: 1 plant-prod (~8 MC gen1) + 3 plants (~6 MC) + Plant tag (~2 MC). Total ~16 MC. Requires -16°C.

**Почему C (57):** Basic plant card with easy requirement. The 3 immediate plants plus 1 plant-prod is modest but playable early when plants help toward greeneries. Per community, plant production cards are generally mediocre in all-expansion games because games are shorter. At 14 MC it's slightly below break-even for gen 1 play. The Plant tag helps NRA and Ecologist. Similar to but worse than Bushes (same cost, 2 plant-prod instead of 1 + 4 plants).

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Insects, Viral Enhancers, NRA, Ecological Zone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 with plant synergy and a path to early greeneries. Not worth keeping for late game.

---

### SF Memorial (#P41) — 57/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 10 MC total (7+3) for 1 card (~4 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Building tag (~1 MC). Total value ~10 MC. Break-even. Steel payable.

**Почему C (57):** Simple, boring card. 10 MC for 1 card + 1 VP is fair but uninspiring. Building tag helps for milestones. Best as a steel dump. shai_aus says 'maybe if desperate.' icehawk84 confirms 'not hugely impactful.' Free draw makes it more playable since you save the 3 MC draft cost.

**Синергии:** Steel production/surplus, Builder milestone, Card draw engines

**Когда брать:** Late game steel dump for 1 VP. Not worth drafting early unless desperate for building tags.

---

### Wave Power (#139) — 57/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 3 oceans | Теги: Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 8+3=11 MC for 1 energy-prod (7.5 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Power tag (~1 MC). Req 3 oceans. Total ~13.5 MC. Slight value gain. Steel-payable helps.

**Почему C (57):** Cheap energy production with a VP bonus. 11 MC for 1 energy-prod + 1 VP is acceptable efficiency. The 3 ocean requirement is usually met by gen 3-4. Power tag is niche. In Colonies, energy for trading adds value. A decent filler card that's never exciting but rarely terrible.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, Thorgate (discount), Protected Habitats, Energy needs, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** When you need energy production and 3 oceans are down. Fine filler. Better with Colonies.

---

### Supermarkets (#X68) — 57/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 2 cities | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC for 2 MC-prod (10-12 MC gen 1) + 1 VP (5 MC). Requires 2 cities. No tags (-3 to -5 MC). Total value ~15-17 MC. Net +3 to +5 MC. But requirement + no tags limits playability.

**Почему C (57):** 2 MC-prod + 1 VP for 12 MC is fair rate, but the 2-city requirement and no tags make it strictly worse than Acquired Company (3 MC-prod + Earth tag for 13 MC, no requirement). You need 2 cities already placed which typically means gen 3-4 at earliest, reducing MC-prod compounding time. No tags provides zero synergy value. The 1 VP partially compensates but does not save the card. Only playable when requirements are already met and nothing better is available.

**Синергии:** City-placing strategies, Mayor milestone, MC-prod engines

**Когда брать:** Only when 2 cities already placed and you need MC-prod. Strictly worse than Acquired Company. Skip if better MC-prod options exist.

### Ants (#035) — 56/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 4% oxygen | Теги: Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC for Microbe tag + action: 1/2 VP per microbe. Self-generating: ~3-4 VP over 6-7 gens (play gen 2-3). Anti-microbe attack is bonus.

**Почему C (56):** Decent VP generator with 1/2 VP per microbe, but slow (1 microbe per gen via action). 4% oxygen requirement is mild. The anti-microbe ability is situational -- sometimes strong (stealing from Decomposers, Tardigrades) but often no good targets. Best with Extreme-Cold Fungus, Enceladus colony, Bactoviral Research. Without these, ~3 VP for 12 MC is merely acceptable.

**Синергии:** Extreme-Cold Fungus, Enceladus colony, Bactoviral Research, Imported Nitrogen, Symbiotic Fungus

**Когда брать:** When you have microbe synergy (Enceladus, Extreme-Cold Fungus) or opponents have vulnerable microbe cards. Mid-priority.

---

### Cloud Tourism (#P69) — 56/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Jovian, Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Prelude 2 | VP: 1/3 resources

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for Venus tag (2-3 MC) + MC-prod per Earth/Venus pair. With 2 pairs: 2 MC-prod (10 MC). 1/3 VP per floater is slow. Action adds floaters.

**Почему C (56):** Requires both Earth AND Venus tag investment to generate meaningful MC-prod, which is a narrow niche. The 1/3 VP per floater is very slow. With 2 Earth+Venus pairs, 2 MC-prod for 14 MC is fair but requires substantial tag investment. The floater generation helps with Hoverlord milestone. Mostly for dedicated Venus+Earth crossover strategies which are uncommon. Niche but functional.

**Синергии:** Venus Waystation, Point Luna, Earth Office, Hoverlord milestone, Venuphile award

**Когда брать:** When you have 2+ Earth tags AND 2+ Venus tags. Very niche. Skip without dual-tag investment.

---

### Community Services (#C04) — 56/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC for 1 VP (5 MC) + N MC-prod where N = no-tag cards (including this). Average 2-3 no-tag cards: 2-3 MC-prod (10-15 MC). No tags = -3 to -5.

**Почему C (56):** The no-tag penalty is somewhat mitigated since the card actively rewards having no-tag cards. With 3 no-tag cards (including itself) you get 3 MC-prod + 1 VP for 16 MC, which is acceptable. But building around no-tag cards is generally a losing strategy since tags are valuable. Best as a side benefit when you happen to have several no-tag cards (Caretaker Contract, Indentured Workers, etc.). The Sagitta corp synergy is notable.

**Синергии:** Sagitta corp, Caretaker Contract, Indentured Workers, No-tag cards

**Когда брать:** When you have 3+ no-tag cards already. Not worth building around.

---

### Geothermal Power (#117) — 56/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC cost. Returns: 2 energy-prod (~15 MC gen1) + Power+Building tags (~3 MC). Total ~18 MC. Efficiency: 7 MC per energy-prod.

**Почему C (56):** Straightforward energy production card at fair but unexciting value. 14 MC for 2 energy production is ~7 MC per energy-prod, which is the same as SP Power Plant (11 MC for 1) after accounting for the card cost. The Power+Building tags provide some tag synergy. Per community, it's playable but rarely exciting — you'd rather find energy from cheaper sources or cards that do more than just give energy.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, Physics Complex, Steelworks, Fusion Power requirement, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 when you need energy production and nothing better is available. Steel payable helps.

---

### Luxury Foods (#237) — 56/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 1 Venus tag / 1 Earth tag / 1 Jovian tag | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 8 MC + 3 MC card = 11 MC for 2 VP (~10 MC). Requires Venus+Earth+Jovian tags. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. 5.5 MC/VP.

**Почему C (56):** Mediocre VP card with no tags. At 5.5 MC per VP it's slightly above the 5 MC/VP threshold but the triple tag requirement and no tags on the card itself make it unexciting. Good last-gen point dump if requirements are met. The requirements are usually met naturally with all expansions. No ongoing value, pure VP. Not worth going out of your way for.

**Синергии:** Vitor, End-game VP dump

**Когда брать:** Last gen point dump when you meet the requirements and have nothing better. Don't draft unless requirements are easy.

---

### Phobos Space Haven (#021) — 56/C

Стоимость: 25 MC | Теги: Space, City | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 3

**Экономика:** Cost 25+3=28 MC (ti payable). Value: 3 VP (15) + 1 ti-prod (12.5) + Space+City tags (2-3) + city (no Mars bonuses). Total ~30-31 MC. Net ~+2-3 MC but ti-prod is often wasted late.

**Почему C (56):** 3 VP for 28 MC (ti payable) is okay as late-game titanium dump, but the 1 titanium production is wasted if played late. The city isn't on Mars so it doesn't count for most awards/milestones. shai_aus rates it too expensive and bad value. icehawk84 prefers Interstellar Colony Ship. Only play as an endgame titanium dump.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Jovian strategies, Mayor milestone (on Tharsis), Ganymede Colony

**Когда брать:** Last 1-2 gens as titanium dump for 3 VP. Don't play for production -- too slow.

---

### Physics Complex (#095) — 56/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Science, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 2/resource

**Экономика:** Cost 12+3=15 MC (steel payable). Action: 6 energy -> 2 VP. At 3 uses = 6 VP for 15 + ~18 energy cost = 33 MC total. 5.5 MC/VP. Science+Building tags (4-7).

**Почему C (56):** The 'newbie trap' card that looks amazing but is usually mediocre. 6 energy per action is an enormous cost that could be used for temperature/trading. icehawk84 notes it's a scaling late-game card but warns against early play. SoupsBane calculates 4 uses minimum for playability. The Science+Building tags are the best part. Only good with Mass Converter-level energy surplus.

**Синергии:** Mass Converter, Quantum Extractor, Viron, Project Inspection, Thorgate

**Когда брать:** Only with 6+ energy production and no better use for it. The tags alone can justify it as a steel dump.

---

### Robot Pollinators (#X45) — 56/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 4% oxygen | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 12 MC total (9+3) for 1 plant prod (~8 MC) + X plants (1 per plant tag). No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Req 4% oxygen. Worse Insects without plant tag.

**Почему C (56):** Mediocre plant production card without a plant tag, which is a significant downside (no NRA/Insects synergy). The plant-per-tag bonus is variable and often small. benbever confirms it has no plant tag despite appearances. No tag penalty hurts. Comparable to Grass but strictly worse than Insects.

**Синергии:** Plant-heavy strategies, Sagitta (no-tag bonus), Community Services

**Когда брать:** Only when you have many plant tags and need the extra plants for a greenery. Low priority.

---

### Special Permit (#P82) — 56/C

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: Greens ruling | Теги: Plant | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 8 MC total (5+3) for steal 4 plants from opponent + Plant event tag. Req: Greens ruling or 2 delegates. Take-that in 3P. 4 stolen plants = 0.5 greenery swing.

**Почему C (56):** Take-that card in 3P format deserves penalty. Stealing 4 plants hurts one opponent but benefits the third for free. Greens requirement adds timing difficulty. Plant tag is nice for synergies. Not as bad as pure take-that cards since you gain the plants yourself, making it a resource transfer rather than pure destruction. Very situational.

**Синергии:** Greens political strategy, Plant tag synergies, NRA (plant tag), Greenery strategies

**Когда брать:** Only when Greens are ruling and you can immediately use the stolen plants. Niche.

---

### Supercapacitors (#X46) — 56/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for 1 MC-prod (5-6 MC) + energy storage ability + Power+Building tags. Tags for Aridor/Diversifier worth ~2-4 MC. Energy storage helps with Colony trading.

**Почему C (56):** Cheap card with useful dual tags. The 1 MC-prod alone almost justifies the cost. Energy storage is niche but helpful for Colonies trading when you have 2 energy-prod. benbever details good use cases. Mostly a tag card with a small production bonus. Fine but low impact.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Aridor, Colonies trading, Industrialist award, Physics Complex

**Когда брать:** When tags matter (Diversifier, Builder milestones) or with Colonies and limited energy. Cheap enough to play most times.

### Water to Venus (#254) — 56/C

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC (ti-payable) for 1 Venus TR (9 MC). Space event tag. With discounts (IC -2, space discounts -2 to -4): can be 2-6 MC for 1 TR. With Optimal Aerobraking: +3 heat bonus.

**Почему C (56):** icehawk84 says 'efficient with all possible discounts and rebates but never exciting.' benbever details how with discounts/ti this can be near-free TR. FieldMouse007 calls it 'ok card, cheaper standard project.' The Space event tag makes it flexible for Legend, IC, Media Group. Not bad, just unexciting - a discount-dependent card.

**Синергии:** IC rebate, Optimal Aerobraking, Space discounts, Legend milestone, Venus requirements

**Когда брать:** When you have space/event discounts and need Venus TR. Ti-payable makes it accessible. Late-game ti dump.

### Windmills (#168) — 56/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 7% oxygen | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC (steel-payable) for 1 energy-prod (7.5 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Power+Building tags (~2-3 MC). Req 7% O2. Total ~15 MC. Very cheap with steel.

**Почему C (56):** shai_aus says 'it's fine. Pretty cheap, gives you a point, lets you use excess steel.' Power+Building dual tags are useful for Builder milestone and energy needs. 7% O2 requirement (step 10/14) limits to mid-late game. With steel payment it's very cheap for 1 VP + energy. Modest but efficient.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, Thorgate, Steel dump, Builder milestone, Energy needs

**Когда брать:** When 7% O2 is met and you have steel. Cheap VP + energy. Fine filler for late game.

### Biomass Combustors (#183) — 56/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: 6% oxygen | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for 2 energy-prod (14 MC gen 1) - 1 VP (5 MC) - take-that penalty (steal plant-prod). Power+Building tags (4-6 MC). 6% O2 req. Net +6-8 MC. But take-that in 3P: -5 to -10.

**Почему C (56):** Cheap 2 energy-prod with good Power+Building tags, but the -1 VP and mandatory plant-prod steal hurt significantly. The take-that aspect in 3P helps the third player, which is the cardinal sin of multiplayer strategy. Power+Building dual tag is premium for requirements and steel payability. The 6% O2 requirement is moderate. At 7 MC for 2 energy-prod the rate is excellent (3.5 MC/prod) but the -1 VP and social cost bring it down. Best when the plant-prod steal targets someone already losing.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Manutech, Energy-dependent strategies, Building engines

**Когда брать:** Gen 2-4 when you desperately need energy-prod and the plant-prod steal targets the leader. Power+Building tags are the draw. Skip if take-that would help a rival.

---

### House Printing (#P36) — 56/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC for 1 steel-prod (7.5 MC gen 1 at 2 MC/steel + Building bonus) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Building tag (steel-payable). Total value ~12-13 MC. Net -1 to 0 MC. Break-even at best.

**Почему C (56):** 1 steel-prod for 13 MC is slightly overpriced. Steel-prod value depends on Building card availability -- with many Building targets, steel is worth 3-4 MC each (9-12 MC/prod) making this decent. Without Building targets, steel sits unused. 1 VP and Building tag add moderate value. Steel-payable via Building tag helps but at 2 steel = 8 MC saving, the effective cost drops to ~5 MC which is better. Overall a marginal card that breaks even at best. Not bad but not exciting.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Mining Guild, Building-heavy strategies, Steel consumers

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with Building-heavy strategy and steel consumers. Steel-payable reduces cost. Skip gen 3+ or without Building card targets for the steel.

---

### Air-Scrapping Expedition (#215) — 55/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: event | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC for 1 Venus TR (7 MC) + 3 floaters (~3-4.5 MC). Net ~10.5 MC, overpays by ~5.5 MC. Ti-payable. Event tag has synergy value.

**Почему C (55):** Slightly cheaper than the Venus standard project (15 MC), with 3 bonus floaters and a Venus tag. The floaters add value if you have Stratopolis, Floating Habs, or Hoverlord milestone. Without floater targets, it is mediocre -- paying 16 MC for 1 TR is poor. The Venus event tag enables Media Group, Optimal Aerobraking synergies. Situational but acceptable with the right floater cards.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Stratopolis, Floating Habs, Aerial Mappers, Dirigibles

**Когда брать:** When you have Venus floater cards in play and need a Venus raise. Skip without floater synergy.

---

### City Parks (#X71) — 55/C

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: 3 cities | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for 2 VP (10 MC) + 2 plants (4 MC) + Building tag (1-2 MC). Total ~15 MC. Requires 3 cities. Building tag, steel-payable.

**Почему C (55):** 2 VP + 2 plants for 10 MC is good value, but the 3 cities requirement is very hard to meet. Most players play 1-2 cities in a typical 3P game. You need to be specifically building cities for this to work, which is generally not an efficient strategy. If you happen to have 3 cities (rare), the card is cheap VP. Steel-payable is nice. Too conditional for most games.

**Синергии:** City-heavy strategies, Builder milestone, Mayor milestone, Mining Guild

**Когда брать:** Only when you have or expect 3 cities, which is rare in 3P. Do not build cities to enable this.

---

### Comet Aiming (#X16) — 55/C

Стоимость: 17 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 17+3=20 MC for Space tag. Action: 1 ti -> 1 asteroid (2 gens = 1 ocean). 1st ocean: 23 MC (including 1 ti). Better than Aquifer Pumping rate but still slow.

**Почему C (55):** Better than Aquifer Pumping but still expensive upfront (20 MC). Converting titanium to oceans every 2 gens is decent if you have ti-production. With Astrodrill or external asteroid sources, much better (1 ocean per gen). Without asteroid synergy, ~2-3 oceans over the game for ~25-30 MC total is acceptable but not exciting. Space tag is useful. Main value is with asteroid card combos.

**Синергии:** Astrodrill, Directed Impactors, Asteroid Deflection System, Asteroid Rights

**Когда брать:** When you have ti-production and asteroid card synergy. Medium priority with Astrodrill. Lower without.

---

### Comet for Venus (#218) — 55/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC for 1 Venus TR (7 MC) + remove 4 MC from Venus-tagged player (~2-4 MC value in 3P). Space tag (1-2 MC). Ti-payable. Event synergies.

**Почему C (55):** 1 MC cheaper than Venus standard project, with a minor attack. In 3P the MC removal helps the third player (take-that penalty). Ti-payable via Space tag. Event tag enables synergies. Mostly played as a cheap Venus raise with ti payment and event rebates. Without discounts, barely better than the standard project. The attack is too minor and conditional to matter much.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Media Group, Phobolog, Venus Waystation, Solar Logistics

**Когда брать:** When you need a Venus raise and have ti/event discounts. Skip without discounts.

---

### Directed Impactors (#X19) — 55/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 8 MC + 3 MC card = 11 MC cost. Action: 6 MC (ti payable) → 1 asteroid → spend for 1 temp raise. Effective: ~17 MC per TR (11 initial + 6 per use). With ti: cheaper.

**Почему C (55):** A mediocre terraforming engine. 6 MC + 2 actions per TR is slow and expensive compared to standard projects. Per FieldMouse007, needs to raise temperature at least 2-3 times to be playable. Per icehawk84, asteroid cards tend to eat titanium needed for better things. The Space tag and ti payability help somewhat. Only worth it if rushing temperature early with titanium to spare.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys, Asteroid Mining Consortium, any ti production

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 if rushing temperature with excess titanium. Skip if mid-game or later.

---

### Greenhouses (#096) — 55/C

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Plant, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 6 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 9 MC cost. Returns: X plants where X = cities in play. In 3P mid-game typically 2-4 cities = 2-4 plants (~4-8 MC). Plant+Building tags (~3 MC).

**Почему C (55):** Cheap one-shot plant generator that scales with cities. In 3P with 3-4 cities, you get 3-4 plants for 9 MC which is barely break-even. The Plant+Building tags help NRA and Builder. Per community, it's a late-game play when more cities are down and plants are worth more for final greenery conversions. Very dependent on city count which varies widely. Steel payable is nice.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, NRA, Insects, Mining Guild, Viral Enhancers

**Когда брать:** Late game with 5+ cities for a final plant burst toward greenery conversion. Low priority otherwise.

---

### Hired Raiders (#124) — 55/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 1 MC + 3 MC card = 4 MC cost. Steal 2 steel (~4 MC) or 3 MC. Nearly cost-neutral. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему C (55):** Almost breaks even on its own which is rare for attack cards. In 3P, stealing from one opponent helps the third player, but the near-zero net cost mitigates this. No tags is a significant penalty. Better in 2P. With IC/Media Group it becomes genuinely profitable. The steal can disrupt key steel plays.

**Синергии:** IC, Media Group, Electro Catapult, Viron

**Когда брать:** When you have event rebates or need to disrupt a specific opponent's steel plans. Don't draft early without synergies.

---

### Hydrogen to Venus (#231) — 55/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC for 1 Venus TR (~7 MC). Floaters are conditional on Jovian tags AND Venus floater card. Space tag for titanium payment. Without floaters: 7 MC value for 14 MC = bad.

**Почему C (55):** Overpriced Venus TR without the floater bonus. Requires both Jovian tags AND a Venus floater card to get good value, which is an unlikely combo. As a titanium dump for 1 Venus TR it's barely passable at 14 MC (vs 15 MC standard project). The Space tag and ti-payable save it from F-tier. Highly situational.

**Синергии:** Dirigibles, Floating Habs, Celestic, Phobolog, Optimal Aerobraking

**Когда брать:** Only when you have Jovian tags AND a Venus floater card. Otherwise, pass.

---

### Ironworks (#101) — 55/C

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC upfront. Action: 4 energy (~6 MC) for 1 O2 step (7 MC TR) + 1 steel (2 MC) = ~9 MC value. Net per use: +3 MC. Need 4+ uses to pay off the card.

**Почему C (55):** Niche oxygen bumper that requires significant energy investment. In 3P with all expansions, energy is often needed for colony trading, making the 4 energy per use expensive. Need 4+ bumps to break even, which requires ~5 gens of use. Better in 2P where there's less competition for oxygen track and more generations. The Building tag and steel output are minor bonuses.

**Синергии:** Manutech, Energy Market, Callisto colony, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** When you have 4+ energy production with no colony trading needs and want to compete on oxygen track. Mostly a 2P card.

---

### Local Shading (#235) — 55/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 4 MC + 3 MC card = 7 MC. Venus tag. Action: add 1 floater or spend 1 floater for +1 MC-prod. Effectively: 1 MC-prod per 2 actions, but can receive floaters from other sources.

**Почему C (55):** Cheap Venus tag with a slow MC production engine. Building MC-prod one at a time over 2 actions is extremely slow, but the card is so cheap that even 2-3 MC-prod over the game is acceptable. Better as a floater target for other cards. The Venus tag has synergy value. Cheap enough to play just for the tag without feeling bad.

**Синергии:** Venus floater cards, Dirigibles, Venus tag strategy, Banker award

**Когда брать:** When you need a cheap Venus tag or a floater target. The MC-prod generation is a bonus, not the primary reason.

---

### Magnetic Field Generators:promo (#X33) — 55/C

Стоимость: 22 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 22+3=25 MC (steel payable). Value: 2 plant-prod (16) + 3 TR (22.2) + tile = 38+. But -4 energy-prod is huge (-30). Net ~8 MC value. Building tag helps.

**Почему C (55):** The massive energy cost of -4 makes this extremely situational. You need heavy energy surplus to even consider it. The TR + plant-prod package is solid but the energy requirement locks it into late-game niche plays. Building tag and steel-payable help slightly.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Mass Converter, Quantum Extractor, Robotic Workforce, Mining Guild

**Когда брать:** Only when you have 5+ energy production with no better use for it. Late-game steel dump with excess energy.

---

### Market Manipulation (#C23) — 55/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** Cost 1+3=4 MC. Value: +1 colony track step (~2-3 MC) + deny opponent ~2-3 MC. Net roughly break-even. Earth tag worth 2-3 MC. Event tag for Legend.

**Почему C (55):** Low impact but cheap. The Earth+Event tag combo enables rebates (Media Group +3, IC +2, Point Luna card). Without rebates it's marginally worth playing; with rebates it becomes decent. Krazyguy75 argues it's too low-impact; benbever says it's almost always good. In 3P it's solidly mediocre.

**Синергии:** Media Group, Interplanetary Cinematics, Point Luna, Martian Zoo, Teractor

**Когда брать:** When you have event/Earth tag rebates. Low draft priority otherwise. Good as a free draw.

---

### Mining Expedition (#063) — 55/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 12+3=15 MC. Value: 1 O2 TR (7-7.4) + 2 steel (4 MC) - take-that penalty (5-10 in 3P). Net ~-4 to +1 MC. No tags = penalty.

**Почему C (55):** The 2 plant removal is take-that which hurts in 3P (helps the 3rd player for free). The no-tag penalty compounds the issue. The O2 raise is useful for snatching the 8% temperature bonus or enabling requirements. 2 steel is a small consolation. Niche applications exist but generally mediocre.

**Синергии:** Interplanetary Cinematics, Media Group, Arctic Algae, Birds (enabling 13% O2)

**Когда брать:** To snatch O2 bonuses or end the game. Take-that in 3P is a real downside. Low priority in draft.

---

### Ore Processor (#104) — 55/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 13+3=16 MC (steel payable). Action: spend 4 energy for 1 titanium (3 MC) + 1 O2 raise (7-7.4 MC). Net ~4-4.4 MC/action minus 8 MC energy cost. Building tag (1-2).

**Почему C (55):** One of the better oxygen bumpers. Costs 4 energy per O2 which is better than Iron/Steelworks ratios, and the titanium bonus adds value. icehawk84 ranks it 2nd best bumper after Steelworks. Niche but powerful against plant-production opponents. With colonies, the energy competition makes it less attractive.

**Синергии:** Mass Converter, Nuclear Power, Steelworks, Physics Complex alternative, Against plant-heavy opponents

**Когда брать:** When you have 4+ energy production and want to deny oxygen to plant players. Not worth setting up specifically for.

---

### Public Celebrations (#T10) — 55/C

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: Chairman | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Turmoil | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 11 MC total (8+3) for 2 VP. That is 5.5 MC/VP - fair but not great. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Chairman requirement manageable in 3P.

**Почему C (55):** Mediocre VP card with no tags. 5.5 MC/VP is acceptable but not exciting. Chairman requirement is fairly easy to meet at least once per game in 3P. Krazyguy75 calls it 'perfectly mediocre.' Better with IC/Media Group/Vitor discounts. Late game only.

**Синергии:** Vitor (-3 MC), IC (-2 MC), Media Group (-3 MC), Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Late game when you have Chairman status. Not worth drafting early. Free draw is fine.

---

### Release of Inert Gases (#036) — 55/C

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 17 MC total (14+3) for 2 TR (~14.8 MC). Slight overpay. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. TR is MC-prod + VP anti-synergy.

**Почему C (55):** Average card that is never great but never terrible. 2 neutral TR for 17 MC is slightly overpriced. No tags is a real penalty. icehawk84 says opponents 'love when their friends play it.' benbever notes TR's income+VP anti-synergy makes it mediocre at any point in the game. Better with event discounts.

**Синергии:** UNMI, IC/Media Group, Terraformer milestone, Legend milestone, Benefactor award

**Когда брать:** Late game for VP, or mid-game with event discounts. Never a high priority.

---

### Search For Life (#005) — 55/C

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: Max 6% oxygen | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: special

**Экономика:** 6 MC total (3+3) for cheapest Science tag + stall action + lottery for 3 VP. Max 6% O2 requirement. ~15-20% chance of hitting microbe tag per flip.

**Почему C (55):** Cheapest science tag in the game, which is its primary value. The 3 VP lottery is mathematically poor but provides a stall action. Krazyguy75 calls it 'overrated' and notes 6 MC is expensive for a science tag that does nothing else. benbever argues the science tag has real value for unlocking requirements. Max O2 limits playability window.

**Синергии:** Science requirements, AI Central unlock, Stall action value, Diversifier milestone

**Когда брать:** Early game when you need a cheap science tag. The action is bonus, not the reason to play it.

---

### Stanford Torus (#X12) — 55/C

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Space, City | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for 2 VP. Ti-payable (Space tag). With space discounts can go down to 9-11 MC. Base rate: 7.5 MC/VP is poor. City tag for Mayor helps.

**Почему C (55):** Krazyguy75 correctly notes 15 MC for 2 VP is an awful rate. benbever adds that space discounts and titanium payment help significantly. Best as a late-game ti dump or Mayor push. City+Space tags have some synergies but the card itself is mediocre.

**Синергии:** Pets, Immigrant City, Rover Construction, Vitor, Mayor milestone

**Когда брать:** Late game as a titanium dump or if competing for Mayor. With space discounts it becomes more playable.

---

### Tectonic Stress Power (#145) — 55/C

Стоимость: 18 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 18+3=21 MC (steel-payable) for 3 energy-prod (22.5 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + Power+Building tags. Req 2 Science. Value ~29 MC. Good deal if played early.

**Почему C (55):** Fair price for 3 energy, but the 2 science tag requirement makes it hard to play gen 1. Without Colonies, energy is less valuable and this is D-tier. With Colonies, 3 energy for trading is excellent and this jumps to B-tier. shai_aus says 'if it were 3-5 MC cheaper I'd like it more.' Format-dependent.

**Синергии:** Colonies trading, Strip Mine, Water Splitting Plant, Physics Complex, Thorgate

**Когда брать:** With Colonies and 2+ science tags already. Steel payment makes it more affordable. Skip without Colonies unless you have specific energy needs.

---

### Unexpected Application (#P86) — 55/C

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC + 1 card discard (3-4 MC) = ~10-11 MC effective for 1 Venus TR (9 MC) + Venus tag (~2-3 MC). Roughly break-even. Cheap Venus terraforming.

**Почему C (55):** No COTD data available. Simple analysis: discard a card + 7 MC for 1 Venus TR is roughly equivalent to standard project asteroid in efficiency but for Venus. The Venus tag helps Venuphile. Cheap event for Legend milestone. Decent but not exciting, and Venus TR is less universally useful than heat/ocean.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Venuphile award, Venus requirements, Legend milestone, Aphrodite

**Когда брать:** When you need to push Venus for requirements or Venuphile. Cheap enough to be fine filler.

---

### Urbanized Area (#120) — 55/C

Стоимость: 10 MC | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 10+3=13 MC (steel-payable) - 1 energy-prod (7.5 MC) = ~20.5 MC effective for city tile + 2 MC-prod (10-12 MC). Req: adjacent to 2 cities. Disruptive placement value hard to quantify.

**Почему C (55):** Niche city card that requires 2 adjacent cities - hard to enable in competitive 3P play where good players avoid enabling it. shai_aus says 'pretty niche' and experienced players avoid creating the setup. ad_hocNC confirms 'good players aren't playing many cities anyway.' Mostly a disruption tool against opponents' city clusters.

**Синергии:** Mayor milestone, Commercial District, Opponent's cities, Steel payment, Greenery adjacency

**Когда брать:** When 2 cities are adjacent on the board and you can exploit the placement. Disruption value in 3P. Otherwise skip.

---

### Asteroid Deflection System (#X14) — 55/C

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Space, Earth, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC + energy-prod (~7 MC) = 23 MC effective. Space+Earth+Building tags (5-8 MC). Action: spend 6 MC → add asteroid resource (1 VP = 5 MC). Plant protection effect. Ti/steel payable. VP/action rate ~-1 MC/action net. Need 5+ gens to accumulate meaningful VP.

**Почему C (55):** Triple tag (Space+Earth+Building) is premium and the main draw. Ti-payable and steel-payable via tags. The action is expensive: 6 MC per asteroid (1 VP = 5 MC), so each action loses ~1 MC but gains VP. Over 4-5 gens: 4-5 VP for 24-30 MC in actions. The plant protection effect is marginal. The upfront cost is very high at 23 MC effective. Best for players who need the triple tag and have excess MC in late game for VP generation. Without tag synergies this is overpriced VP.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Point Luna, Mining Guild, Triple tag synergies, VP strategies

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-3 for triple tag value (Space+Earth+Building). The action VP is secondary. Ti/steel payable reduces effective cost significantly. Skip without tag synergies.

---

### Diversity Support (#X20) — 55/C

Стоимость: 1 MC | Требования: {'resourceTypes': 9, 'count': 9} | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 1+3=4 MC for 1 TR (7-7.4 MC). Requires 9 different resource types. No tags (-3 to -5 MC). Net +3 MC if requirement met. Condition is very hard to achieve.

**Почему C (55):** 1 TR for 4 MC is outstanding rate if the requirement is met. But 9 different resource types is one of the hardest requirements in the game. Standard resources: MC, steel, titanium, plants, energy, heat (6). Need 3 more from: microbes, animals, floaters, fighters, asteroids, data, etc. This requires diverse resource placement which is inconsistent. No tags adds to the penalty. When it fires it is great value, but the requirement gates it heavily. Many games you cannot reach 9 resource types. Keep in hand speculatively but often unplayable.

**Синергии:** Diverse resource strategies, Floater+Microbe+Animal engines, Psychrophiles, Decomposers

**Когда брать:** Draft speculatively if you have 6+ resource types already and path to 9. At 4 MC cost, the payoff is excellent IF achievable. Often unplayable -- low floor, decent ceiling.

### Venus Waystation (#258) — 53/D

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Venus, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC (ti-payable) for -2 MC per Venus tag played + 1 VP (5 MC) + Venus+Space tags (~3-4 MC). Need 4 Venus tags played after this to break even on the discount alone.

**Почему D (53):** Krazyguy75 highlights the core problem: need 4 Venus tags to break even, and most Venus cards are mediocre. In all-expansions play, Venus tags are diluted. shai_aus agrees. Best for Morning Star Inc who can guarantee Venus plays. The 1 VP and ti-payment help, but the effect is too narrow for most games.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Venus Governor (plays for free), Venus heavy strategy, Venuphile award, Titanium dump

**Когда брать:** Only when committed to Venus strategy with 3+ Venus cards in hand. Morning Star Inc priority pick.

### Adapted Lichen (#048) — 52/D

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC for 1 plant-prod (8 MC gen 1). Plant tag worth 1-2 MC. Net value ~10 MC, cost 12. Slightly overpriced.

**Почему D (52):** No-requirement plant production is convenient but expensive at 12 MC for 1 plant-prod. The Plant tag is valuable for NRA, Insects, Ecologist milestone, but standalone the card is weak. Regular Lichen costs 7 MC with an easy requirement. Only worth it gen 1-2 if the tag enables an important combo like NRA.

**Синергии:** Nitrogen Rich Asteroid, Insects, Ecologist milestone, Ecological Zone, Viral Enhancers

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 only if Plant tag enables NRA or milestone. Otherwise prefer cheaper plant-prod cards like Lichen or Archaebacteria.

---

### Commercial District (#085) — 52/D

Стоимость: 16 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: special

**Экономика:** 16+3=19 MC + 1 energy-prod (7.5 MC) = 26.5 MC. 4 MC-prod (20 MC) + 1-2 VP (5-10 MC) + Building tag (1-2 MC). Steel-payable. Total ~26-33 MC.

**Почему D (52):** Too expensive for most situations. 26+ MC effective cost for 4 MC-prod + variable VP is poor early game and the VP is unreliable since experienced players do not cluster cities. The special tile placement is flexible but you are paying a premium for it. As a late-game steel dump with unused energy, it is acceptable. Can swing Banker award. But the card often disappoints -- your VP from adjacency ends up being 1-2 at best.

**Синергии:** Banker award, Landlord award, Estate Dealer award, Steel surplus

**Когда брать:** Late game steel dump with excess energy, or to swing Banker/Landlord awards. Skip as an economy play.

---

### Extreme-Cold Fungus (#134) — 52/D

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: Max -10°C | Теги: Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 13 MC + 3 MC card = 16 MC cost. Action: gain 1 plant OR add 2 microbes to any card. Max -10°C requirement. Microbe tag. As plant gen: 16 MC for ~1 plant-prod = terrible. As microbe feeder: depends on target.

**Почему D (52):** Too expensive as a plant generator (16 MC for 1 plant/gen is far worse than Adapted Lichen at 12 MC). The microbe feeding action is the real value, but requires a premium microbe target like GHG Producing Bacteria or Sulphur-Eating Bacteria. Per ad_hocNC, it's 'not worth it most of the time' and 'GHG or bust.' The max -10°C requirement limits it to early game when 16 MC is a huge investment.

**Синергии:** GHG Producing Bacteria, Sulphur-Eating Bacteria, Ants, Decomposers, Enceladus colony

**Когда брать:** Only with a high-value microbe target already in play or in hand. Skip for plant generation alone.

### Interplanetary Trade (#X05) — 52/D

Стоимость: 27 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 27 MC + 3 MC card = 30 MC for N MC-prod (where N = unique tags in play). Need 6+ MC-prod to break even early. Space tag + 1 VP. Ti-payable.

**Почему D (52):** Looks better than it is. At 30 MC cost, you need 6+ different tags for 5 MC/MC-prod ratio, which is barely average. By the time you have 6+ unique tags, it's often mid-late game where production has diminished returns. The 1 VP and Space tag help slightly. Ti-payable is nice but the raw cost is just too high for production.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Diversifier milestone, Banker award

**Когда брать:** Only as titanium dump when you have 7+ unique tags and 4+ gens remaining. Otherwise pass.

### Law Suit (#X06) — 52/D

Стоимость: 2 MC | Теги: Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo | VP: special

**Экономика:** 2 MC + 3 MC card = 5 MC. Steal 3 MC from attacker + give them -1 VP. Net: 3 MC gained + 1 VP denied to opponent. Requires being attacked this generation. Earth tag.

**Почему D (52):** Conditional and unreliable. In 3P, you may not get attacked, or the attack may come from the player you don't want to help by counter-attacking. The -1 VP to the attacker is nice but the 3 MC steal is minor. In 2P it's significantly better as every attack targets you. The psychological deterrent value (opponents afraid to attack) can be worth more than the card itself.

**Синергии:** IC, Media Group, Earth tag synergies

**Когда брать:** In 2P games when you expect to be attacked. In 3P, only as a free draw or if you know you'll be targeted.

### Outdoor Sports (#X38) — 52/D

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: 1 city / 1 oceans | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 8+3=11 MC. Value: 2 MC-prod (10-12) + 1 VP (5). No tags = penalty (-3 to -5). Net ~1-3 MC with penalty. Req: city adjacent to ocean.

**Почему D (52):** Sponsors-like card but with no tags (huge penalty), 2 MC more expensive, and a clunky requirement. The 1 VP partially compensates but not enough. shai_aus and Krazyguy75 both rate it poorly. benbever notes in all-expansion play the requirement is rarely met gen 1-2 when you'd want it. Sagitta and Community Services slightly help.

**Синергии:** Sagitta, Community Services, Vitor, Capital, Banker award

**Когда брать:** Only when a city is already adjacent to an ocean AND you're gen 1-2. Very low priority in draft.

---

### Red Tourism Wave (#T12) — 52/D

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: Reds ruling | Теги: Earth | Тип: event | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 6 MC total (3+3) for variable MC (1 per empty area adjacent to your tiles). Potential 10-20+ MC with good board position. Requires Reds ruling or 2 delegates. Earth tag.

**Почему D (52):** High ceiling but extremely niche. Reds rarely rule in 3P. Ground game players who benefit most from this card typically do not want Reds in power. Krazyguy75 notes the fundamental design contradiction. Earth tag is nice but the card is too unreliable. When it works it can be 15+ MC but that requires perfect storm of conditions.

**Синергии:** Ground game with many tiles, Research Outpost placement, Earth tag synergies, Reds political strategy

**Когда брать:** Only when Reds are already ruling and you have many tiles with empty adjacent spaces. Very situational.

---

### Regolith Eaters (#033) — 52/D

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Science, Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 16 MC total (13+3) for Science+Microbe tags (~6-8 MC) + 1 TR per 3 actions (~2.5 MC/gen). Slow oxygen generation.

**Почему D (52):** Too expensive and too slow for multiplayer. 3 actions for 1 TR is terrible rate. The Science+Microbe tags provide some value but 16 MC is steep. COTD consensus: mostly for solo, rarely playable in multiplayer. ad_hocNC says 'only play if science tag is very valuable.'

**Синергии:** Science engine (tag only), Decomposers (microbe tag), AI Central unlock

**Когда брать:** Only when you desperately need a science tag and have nothing better. The action is almost never worth using.

---

### Sub-zero Salt Fish (#C42) — 52/D

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: -6°C | Теги: Animal | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 5+3=8 MC for 1/2 VP per animal + take-that (-1 plant-prod). At -6C, typically 2-3 gens left = 2-3 animals = 1-1.5 VP. With animal placement: slightly better.

**Почему D (52):** SoupsBane notes temperature is usually the lagging parameter, making the -6C requirement very late. icehawk84 confirms it comes online gen 8-9 in competitive play. 1/2 VP per animal is worse than Birds/Fish. Take-that element is minor. Cheap but arrives too late to accumulate meaningful VP.

**Синергии:** Viral Enhancers, Meat Industries, Decomposers, Ecological Zone, Large Convoy

**Когда брать:** Late game filler if temperature is somehow ahead. Much worse than Fish/Small Animals in practice.

---

### Tundra Farming (#169) — 52/D

Стоимость: 16 MC | Требования: -6°C | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 16+3=19 MC for 1 plant-prod (8 MC) + 2 MC-prod (10-12 MC) + 1 plant (2 MC) + 2 VP (10 MC) + Plant tag. Req -6C. Total ~32 MC value but comes very late.

**Почему D (52):** ad_hocNC calls it 'one of the worst plant cards.' At -6C, only 1-2 gens of plant-prod left, meaning ~1 extra greenery at best. shai_aus prefers Trees (cheaper, more plant-prod, similar requirement). 2 VP for 19 MC is passable but the timing makes everything else low value. Worse than Trees, Farming, Bushes.

**Синергии:** NRA, Insects, Ecoline, Plant tag synergies, Banker award

**Когда брать:** Only if -6C is met and you need the plant tag or the 2 VP. Trees is almost always better if you can wait for -4C.

---

### Asteroid Mining (#040) — 50/D

Стоимость: 30 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 30+3=33 MC for 2 ti-prod (25 MC) + 2 VP (10 MC) + Jovian tag (3-5 MC) + Space tag (1-2 MC). Total ~39-42 MC. Ti-payable. Break-even ~gen 4 if played gen 1.

**Почему D (50):** Very expensive at 33 MC for production that takes ~5.5 gens to return the investment. The Jovian + Space tags add value for multipliers but the core economics are poor. In 3P/WGT games ending gen 8-9, playing this gen 1 barely breaks even. With Phobolog (ti worth 4 each) the math improves significantly. Without heavy ti synergy, this is too slow and expensive.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Saturn Systems, Jovian multipliers, Mass Converter, Advanced Alloys

**Когда брать:** Phobolog gen 1 or Saturn Systems with ti preludes. Jovian strategy with multipliers. Otherwise skip.

---

### Carbonate Processing (#043) — 50/D

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC + 1 energy-prod (7.5 MC) = 16.5 MC effective. 3 heat-prod (12 MC) + Building tag (1-2 MC). Net ~13 MC for 16.5 MC cost. Overpays.

**Почему D (50):** Converting energy to heat production is a downgrade in most games (energy > heat). 3 heat-prod needs ~24 heat = 3 temperature raises = 3 TR over ~8 gens, but that is slow and the heat-to-TR conversion is inherently overpriced. The Building tag is minor. Only worth it for dedicated heat rushers with excess energy. In 3P/WGT, heat strategies are generally weaker.

**Синергии:** Helion, UNMI, Thermalist award, Generalist milestone

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 only, for dedicated heat rush with excess energy-prod. Otherwise skip.

---

### Cloud Seeding (#004) — 50/D

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: 3 oceans | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11+3=14 MC + 1 MC-prod (5 MC) for 2 plant-prod (16 MC). Net: 14+5=19 MC cost, 16 MC value. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Take-that: -1 heat-prod in 3P = helps 3rd player.

**Почему D (50):** 2 plant-prod for effectively 19 MC is overpriced. The -1 MC-prod and -1 opponent heat-prod downsides are significant. No tags means zero synergy value. The take-that aspect (reducing opponent heat-prod) helps the third player in 3P. The 3 ocean requirement is mild but adds timing constraints. If it had a Plant tag it would be better. As is, a below-average plant production card.

**Синергии:** Plant production strategy, Generalist milestone

**Когда брать:** Only when you have no better plant-prod options and 3 oceans are out. Low priority.

---

### Energy Saving (#189) — 50/D

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 15 MC + 3 MC card = 18 MC cost. Returns: X energy-prod where X = cities in play. In 3P mid-game typically 2-3 cities = 15-22.5 MC. Late game 4-5 cities = 30-37.5 MC but energy less useful.

**Почему D (50):** Too dependent on other players building cities, which in 3P with all expansions happens slowly. Per shai_aus, most decent opponents don't go nuts for city building early. In 3P, you might see 2-3 cities by mid-game at best, making this 18 MC for 2-3 energy production — barely break even. Only shines with Physics Complex combo or in city-heavy metagames. The Power tag is almost irrelevant.

**Синергии:** Physics Complex, Steelworks, Colonies trading, Tharsis Republic opponent, Thermalist award

**Когда брать:** Mid-late game with 4+ cities already in play and a use for energy (colonies, Physics Complex). Otherwise skip.

---

### GHG Shipment (#P75) — 50/D

Стоимость: 3 MC | Требования: Kelvinists ruling | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 3 MC + 3 MC card = 6 MC cost. Returns: 1 heat-prod (~4 MC gen1) + X heat (X = floaters you have). Requires Kelvinists ruling. Event tag.

**Почему D (50):** Highly conditional card with low payoff. Kelvinists ruling requirement adds major friction. 1 heat production for 6 MC is bad value (4 MC return gen1). The floater-to-heat conversion is only good if you have 10+ floaters stored, which is extremely rare. Even then, heat resources are among the least valuable. No meaningful tags beyond event. Almost always skip.

**Синергии:** Floater engine, Kelvinists party, Helion, Titan colony, Thermalist award

**Когда брать:** Only if Kelvinists are ruling, you have 10+ floaters, and need heat. Extremely niche.

---

### Immigration Shuttles (#198) — 50/D

Стоимость: 31 MC | Теги: Earth, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1/3 cities

**Экономика:** 31 MC + 3 MC card = 34 MC for 5 MC-prod (~25 MC gen 1) + 1/3 VP per city (~2-3 VP typical). Earth+Space tags (~4 MC). With titanium: much better. Without: overpriced.

**Почему D (50):** Too expensive for what it provides. At 34 MC, the 5 MC-prod only pays back in ~7 gens which is the whole game. The VP from cities is unreliable since competitive players don't spam cities. Earth+Space tags and ti-payable are the saving graces. Only worthwhile as a titanium dump or with Phobolog. Consistently rated D-tier by experienced players.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Point Luna, Advanced Alloys, Credicor

**Когда брать:** When swimming in titanium with no other space cards to play. Decent Phobolog titanium dump.

---

### Ishtar Mining (#233) — 50/D

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 8% Venus | Теги: Venus | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 5 MC + 3 MC card = 8 MC for 1 ti-prod (~12.5 MC). Requires Venus 8%. Good value IF playable early, but Venus 8% is often mid-game or later. Venus tag. No Building tag, can't pay in steel.

**Почему D (50):** Looks efficient at 8 MC for 12.5 MC ti-prod value, but the Venus 8% requirement typically delays this to mid-game when production has diminishing returns. Compare to Titanium Mine (7 MC, no req, Building tag, steel payable). The Venus tag has some synergy value but the requirement-to-payoff ratio is poor. Only worth it with Morning Star Inc or early Venus terraforming.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Inventrix, Venus tag strategy, Advanced Alloys

**Когда брать:** Only when Venus 8% is already met or about to be met, and you need cheap Venus tag + ti-prod. Otherwise Titanium Mine is better.

---

### Lava Tube Settlement (#P37) — 50/D

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: Building, City | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude

**Экономика:** 15 MC + 3 MC card + 7.5 MC (1 energy prod) = ~25.5 MC for city + 2 MC-prod (~10 MC). Only 2 MC-prod vs typical 3 for cities. Volcanic area restriction severely limits placement.

**Почему D (50):** Overpriced city with terrible placement restrictions. Only 4 legal spots on Tharsis/Elysium, none particularly good for city adjacency VP. The 2 MC-prod vs typical 3 is a significant downgrade. Energy cost is painful. Barely cheaper than SP City (25 MC, no energy cost, free placement). Building+City tags are the only positives. Better on Hellas where volcanic areas have decent bonuses.

**Синергии:** Hellas map, Mining Guild, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Only on Hellas with leftover energy and steel, or for a critical Mayor milestone push.

---

### Microgravity Nutrition (#P79) — 50/D

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Microbe, Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Prelude 2 | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 11+3=14 MC. Value: 1 VP (5) + Microbe+Plant tags (3-4) + 1 MC-prod per colony. At 2 colonies = 10 MC-prod; at 3 = 15. Total ~18-24 with 2-3 colonies.

**Почему D (50):** Requires multiple colonies early to be worthwhile, which is uncommon in 3P. The Microbe+Plant double bio-tag is decent for milestones but the effect is weak. FieldMouse007 calls it mediocre. At 2 colonies it's barely break-even considering gen played. Niche card that rarely excites.

**Синергии:** Poseidon, Aridor, Viral Enhancers, Ecological Zone, Decomposers

**Когда брать:** Only with 3+ colonies already placed early game. The double bio-tag is the main appeal for specific milestones.

---

### Public Plans (#X77) — 50/D

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 10 MC total (7+3) for 1 VP + ~X MC refund (1 MC per revealed card). No tags = big penalty. Revealing hand gives opponents information.

**Почему D (50):** No tags, gives opponents information, and the MC refund is small. 10 MC for 1 VP + a few MC back is poor efficiency. The information leak is a real downside in competitive play. No COTD data confirms it is underplayed. Niche at best.

**Синергии:** Vitor, IC, Legend milestone, Media Group

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only if you have many cards in hand, strong discounts, and need Legend milestone.

---

### Special Design (#206) — 50/D

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 7 MC total (4+3) for +/- 2 steps on next card's requirement + Science event tag. Effectively 7 MC to play a card 1 gen earlier, which is rarely worth 7 MC.

**Почему D (50):** The effect is too small and too expensive. +/- 2 steps is only 1 generation difference in most cases. Krazyguy75 rates it 'extremely hard to justify' and 'awful.' benbever argues it is underrated for unlocking Kelp Farming/Trees early, but even then the 7 MC cost is steep. Science tag has some value. Mostly played as a cheap science event for triggers.

**Синергии:** Inventrix (+2 more = +4 total), Science event triggers (Mars U, IC, Media Group), Kelp Farming/Trees unlock

**Когда брать:** Only when the extra 2 steps unlocks a very powerful card 1 gen earlier. Very niche.

---

### Venusian Insects (#260) — 50/D

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 12% Venus | Теги: Venus, Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 5+3=8 MC for action: add 1 microbe, 1 VP per 2 microbes. Req Venus 12%. Venus+Microbe tags ~3 MC. In 3 gens: 3 microbes = 1.5 VP = ~7.5 MC. Req limits timing.

**Почему D (50):** Similar to Tardigrades but with Venus requirement and slightly better VP rate (1/2 vs 1/4). The Venus 12% requirement delays deployment in all-expansions play. 1 VP per 2 microbes is still subpar for animal placement. Venus+Microbe tags have some value for Ecologist. Strictly worse than 1/resource animals.

**Синергии:** Symbiotic Fungus, Extreme-Cold Fungus, Ecologist milestone, Enceladus colony, Hoverlord

**Когда брать:** When Venus 12% is met and you need VP accumulation. Significantly worse than Stratospheric Birds or Venusian Animals.

---

### Venusian Plants (#261) — 50/D

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: 16% Venus | Теги: Venus, Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 13+3=16 MC for 1 Venus TR (9 MC) + 1 VP (5 MC) + 1 microbe/animal on Venus card (~2-5 MC) + Venus+Plant tags (~3-4 MC). Req Venus 16%. Total ~19-23 MC value if fully used.

**Почему D (50):** Venus 16% (8 steps) is extremely hard to achieve in all-expansions play. shai_aus says '13+3 MC for hopefully 3 points is not amazing.' The microbe/animal placement is limited to Venus cards, restricting value. ThainEshKelch notes 'chances are it won't get played at all.' When playable it's decent, but the requirement kills it.

**Синергии:** Stratospheric Birds, Venusian Animals, Inventrix, Morning Star Inc, Venuphile award

**Когда брать:** Only when Venus is at 16%+ and you have a Venus animal card to place on. Very rare in practice.

---

### Adaptation Technology (#153) — 48/D

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Science | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for 1 VP (5 MC) + Science tag (3-5 MC) + effect. Net value from card itself ~8-10 MC. Effect is situational and rarely worth the 5-7 MC gap.

**Почему D (48):** As COTD commenters unanimously note, the effect is too expensive and too situational for the price. The +/-2 requirement steps rarely matters enough to justify 15 MC. You might play 1-2 cards a generation earlier, but that is usually not worth the investment. The Science tag and VP partially compensate but not enough. Inventrix already gives this effect for free.

**Синергии:** Inventrix, Special Design, Kelp Farming, Birds, Predators

**Когда брать:** Only when you desperately need a Science tag and the effect will let you play 2+ requirement cards earlier. Almost always a pass.

---

### Atmo Collectors (#C03) — 48/D

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC for no tags + 2 floaters. Action: spend 1 floater for 2 energy or 3 heat or 1 MC-prod. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему D (48):** The no-tag penalty hurts significantly. 18 MC for a slow action card that converts floaters to small amounts of resources is poor value. The action choices are flexible but individually weak. You need external floater sources to sustain the action beyond 2 uses. Without tags, you lose all corporate and milestone synergies. Mostly a trap card unless you desperately need specific resources.

**Синергии:** Titan colony, Floater Technology, Dirigibles, Stormcraft

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only if you have abundant floater generation and desperately need energy/heat conversion.

---

### Extractor Balloons (#223) — 48/D

Стоимость: 21 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 21 MC + 3 MC card = 24 MC cost. Starts with 3 floaters. Action: add 1 floater or spend 3 for Venus raise. Gen 1 play: 1 TR immediate, 1 TR gen 3, 1 TR gen 6. ~3 TR for 24 MC over 6 gens.

**Почему D (48):** Overpriced Venus terraformer. At 24 MC, getting 3 TR over 6 generations is too slow — the income from early TR is minimal and games often end before gen 6. Per shai_aus, it's like GHG bacteria but way more expensive and raises Venus instead of temperature. Per benbever's math, it's actually better than most microbe cards due to the 3 starting floaters, but the 24 MC cost is brutal for gen 1 economy. Only good with Celestic/Stormcraft for Hoverlord snipe.

**Синергии:** Celestic, Stormcraft, Floater Technology, Hoverlord milestone, Titan colony

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 with Celestic/Stormcraft for Hoverlord claim. Otherwise too slow and expensive.

---

### Great Escarpment Consortium (#061) — 48/D

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: Production | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 6 MC + 3 MC card = 9 MC cost. Returns: net +1 steel-prod (~8 MC gen1) by taking from another player. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Take-that card.

**Почему D (48):** Classic take-that trap in 3P. You gain 1 steel production while one opponent loses 1 — the third player benefits for free. Per the 3P take-that penalty pattern, this is -5 to -10 score. At 9 MC for 1 steel-prod (~8 MC) with no tags, you're paying slightly above value AND hurting one opponent which helps the third player. The 'requires steel production' clause means you need a target. Avoid in 3P.

**Синергии:** 2P games, Asteroid Mining Consortium, Mining Guild, steel-heavy strategies

**Когда брать:** Rarely in 3P. Only if you desperately need steel production AND one specific opponent has excess. Better in 2P.

---

### Hospitals (#X69) — 48/D

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 8 MC + 3 MC card + 7.5 MC (1 energy prod) = ~18.5 MC cost. 1 VP. Gains 3 MC per city placed (but must have fewer disease resources than threshold). Unreliable income stream.

**Почему D (48):** Confusing and unreliable card. Requires energy production, generates disease resources based on cities which need to be managed through an action, and the MC generation is inconsistent. In 3P games cities aren't placed frequently enough. Essentially a worse version of Martian Rails. The 1 VP and Building tag for steel payment are the only positives.

**Синергии:** Pharmacy Union, Tharsis Republic

**Когда брать:** Rarely. Last-gen cheap VP point with steel if you have nothing better. Skip in most situations.

---

### Neutralizer Factory (#240) — 48/D

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: 10% Venus | Теги: Venus | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** Cost 7+3=10 MC. Value: 1 Venus TR (7-7.4) + Venus tag (2-3). Total ~9-10 MC. Net ~-1 to 0 MC. Req: 10% Venus.

**Почему D (48):** 10 MC for 1 TR is mediocre, and the 10% Venus requirement means you can't play it until mid-game. The Venus tag has some value for Venuphile award. benbever notes it rarely sees play. Most COTD comments are dismissive. It's not terrible but there's almost always something better to spend MC on.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Aphrodite, Venus cards with requirements, Venuphile award

**Когда брать:** Only when Venus is near 14-16% and you want the bonus TR from reaching the threshold. Very low priority.

---

### Snow Algae (#211) — 48/D

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 2 oceans | Теги: Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 15 MC total (12+3) for 1 plant prod (~8 MC) + 1 heat prod (~4-6 MC) + Plant tag (~1-2 MC). Req: 2 oceans. Total value ~13-16 MC. Slightly overpriced.

**Почему D (48):** Overpriced combination of two mediocre productions. shai_aus says 'hard pass, too pricey.' The 2 ocean requirement prevents gen 1 play when production matters most. 1 plant prod + 1 heat prod alone do little. Plant tag is nice but not enough to save the card. icehawk84 confirms the main problem is standalone productions do not do much.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Tharsis Republic, Generalist milestone, Insects (plant tag)

**Когда брать:** Only gen 1-2 with 2 oceans already placed and a plant/heat strategy. Otherwise skip.

---

### Solar Power (#113) — 48/D

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 14 MC total (11+3) for 1 energy prod (~7.5 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Power+Building tags (~2 MC). Total ~14.5 MC. Break-even at best.

**Почему D (48):** Overpriced for what it does. shai_aus says 'too expensive for energy early, too expensive for VP late.' The VP+energy production anti-synergy is the core problem. Only truly playable as a steel dump or when you desperately need energy with a building tag. Worse than Power Plant in almost every way except it has 1 VP.

**Синергии:** Steel dump, Builder milestone, Thorgate, Vitor

**Когда брать:** Late game steel dump for 1 VP. Not worth drafting unless desperate for building/power tags.

---

### Tardigrades (#049) — 48/D

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1/4 resources

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for action: add 1 microbe, 1 VP per 4 microbes. Gen 1 play in 8-gen game: 8 microbes = 2 VP = ~10 MC. Net +3 MC. Microbe tag worth ~1-2 MC.

**Почему D (48):** Krazyguy75 nails it: the biggest downside is opportunity cost of drawing a better card. 2 VP for 7 MC is acceptable, but only with 8+ gens of accumulation. 1/4 VP rate is terrible for animal placement. Vulnerable to Ants. Low impact, low synergy. Fine as filler but not worth prioritizing.

**Синергии:** Enceladus colony, Topsoil Contract, Extreme-Cold Fungus, Ecologist milestone, Viral Enhancers

**Когда брать:** Gen 1 filler when you have nothing better. Cheap tag for Ecologist/Diversifier. Never a priority pick.

---

### Vote Of No Confidence (#T16) — 48/D

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: Party leader: 1 | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 5+3=8 MC for 1 TR (7 MC) + chairman position (1 influence, ~2-4 MC/gen in Turmoil events). Net: slightly positive if requirements met. No tags is a penalty (-3 to -5).

**Почему D (48):** Krazyguy75 correctly identifies the problem: 'neutral chairman + you have a party leader' is out of your control and rarely happens when you need it. The card rots in hand for most of the game. No tags means no synergy value. When it fires, 1 TR + chairman is good for 8 MC. But holding cost and unpredictability make it unreliable.

**Синергии:** Turmoil political events, Chairman influence, Delegate strategy, Legend milestone (event), TR rush

**Когда брать:** Don't hold this early. Maybe draft if it's late game and neutral chairman is about to happen. Otherwise skip.

### Water Splitting Plant (#177) — 48/D

Стоимость: 12 MC | Требования: 2 oceans | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for action: spend 3 energy for 1 O2 TR (7 MC). Energy valued at ~3x7.5=22.5 MC prod. Very expensive per TR. Building tag ~1-2 MC. Req 2 oceans.

**Почему D (48):** Like other O2 bumpers, generally bad in multiplayer because greeneries handle O2 while providing VP. 3 energy per TR is expensive (equivalent to ~22 MC production for an action that gives 7 MC). Only useful with Mass Converter or excess energy in late game. The 2 ocean requirement is usually easy to meet.

**Синергии:** Mass Converter, Thorgate, Excess energy, Factorum, Standard Technology

**Когда брать:** Only with excess energy production and O2 not yet maxed. Rarely correct in competitive 3P play.

### Hackers (#125) — 48/D

Стоимость: 3 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 3+3=6 MC + energy-prod (~7 MC) = 13 MC effective. Steal 2 MC-prod from opponent and gain 2 MC-prod yourself. Net swing: 4 MC-prod (20-24 MC gen 1). But -1 VP (5 MC). No tags (-3 to -5 MC). Take-that in 3P: -5 to -10.

**Почему D (48):** On paper a 4 MC-prod swing for 13 MC seems decent, but the triple penalty (no tags, -1 VP, take-that in 3P) destroys the value. The energy-prod cost is painful. No tags means zero synergy. The -1 VP is a permanent penalty. Most critically, the take-that in 3P helps the third player by weakening one opponent while costing you VP and energy. Compare to Acquired Company: 3 MC-prod + Earth tag for 13 MC with no penalties. Hackers is strictly a spite card with terrible efficiency.

**Синергии:** None significant

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only in desperation when energy is free and the MC-prod steal targets the clear leader. Even then the -1 VP and no tags make it questionable.

### Callisto Penal Mines (#082) — 46/D

Стоимость: 24 MC | Теги: Jovian, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 24+3=27 MC for 3 MC-prod (15 MC) + 2 VP (10 MC) + Jovian tag (3-5 MC) + Space tag (1-2 MC). Total ~29-32 MC. Ti-payable. Break-even after ~8+ gens.

**Почему D (46):** As COTD unanimously agrees, way too expensive for what it does. MC-prod and VP have anti-synergy (one is early-game, other is late-game). 27 MC for 3 MC-prod in gen 1 barely returns the investment by game end. The Jovian + Space tags add some value for multiplier strategies, but there are cheaper Jovian tags. Only playable as a ti dump with Phobolog or with Jovian multipliers. Classic Jovian trap.

**Синергии:** Saturn Systems, Phobolog, Jovian multipliers, Rim Settler milestone

**Когда брать:** Only when playing Jovian strategy with multipliers or as a late-game ti dump for the Jovian tag.

### Capital (#008) — 46/D

Стоимость: 26 MC | Требования: 4 oceans | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: special

**Экономика:** 26+3=29 MC + 2 energy-prod (15 MC) = 44 MC effective. 5 MC-prod (25 MC) + special VP (1/ocean adj, typically 2-4 VP = 10-20 MC). Steel-payable. 4 ocean req.

**Почему D (46):** The most expensive city in the game. Even counting ocean adjacency VP (typically 2-3 VP), the economics are poor. 44 MC effective cost for 5 MC-prod that takes 9+ gens to return. The 4 ocean requirement limits when you can play it. The VP from ocean adjacency is variable and often disappointing. Only worth it as a very late-game steel dump with excess energy. Most experienced players consider it a trap.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Artificial Lake, Estate Dealer award, Ceres colony

**Когда брать:** Late game only, with excess steel and energy production. Good placement spots are rare.

---

### Forced Precipitation (#226) — 46/D

Стоимость: 8 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 8 MC + 3 MC card = 11 MC cost. Action: 2 MC → 1 floater, or spend 2 floaters for Venus raise. Effective: 15 MC for first Venus TR in gen 3. 19 MC for second in gen 6. Very slow.

**Почему D (46):** Bad Venus terraformer. Per Krazyguy75, the math shows 12 MC effort for 8-9 MC in Venus value — poor ROI. Per benbever's detailed analysis, it's worse than Giant Solar Shade, Extractor Balloons, and even Thermophiles despite having no requirement. The 3-gen delay for first TR is crippling. Only the Venus tag and floater target capability provide some value. Per Futuralis, it's almost never played.

**Синергии:** Venus tag for requirements, Dirigibles, Floater Technology, Titan colony, Venuphile award

**Когда брать:** Only as a cheap Venus tag or when you have external floater sources. Very low priority for actual Venus terraforming.

### Sabotage (#121) — 46/D

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 4 MC total (1+3) to remove 7 MC / 4 steel / 3 titanium from opponent. No tags. Take-that in 3P = -5 to -10. Pure attack with no self-benefit.

**Почему D (46):** Classic take-that trap in 3P. You spend 4 MC to hurt one opponent, benefiting the third player for free. No tags, no self-benefit. Krazyguy75 dislikes the entire category. Only playable for free with IC/Media Group or to deny a specific milestone. benbever notes it is played more in 2P.

**Синергии:** IC (event rebate), Media Group, Legend milestone, Deny opponent milestones

**Когда брать:** Almost never in 3P. Only with event rebates/discounts or to deny a critical milestone.

### Colonial Envoys (#P70) — 45/D

Стоимость: 4 MC | Требования: Unity ruling | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Prelude 2

**Экономика:** 4+3=7 MC for delegates (value depends on colonies owned, ~3-5 MC per delegate). Requires Unity ruling + colonies + turmoil. No tags. Very restrictive.

**Почему D (45):** Triple restriction: needs Unity ruling, colonies expansion, and turmoil expansion, plus you need multiple colonies built. No tags. Even when playable, placing 2-3 delegates is a minor effect worth maybe 6-15 MC. The conditions align too rarely to be reliable. No COTD expert data (only 1 non-key comment). Too narrow for consistent value.

**Синергии:** Colony-heavy strategy, Turmoil manipulation

**Когда брать:** Only with 3+ colonies and Unity is ruling or about to rule. Very low priority.

---

### Equatorial Magnetizer (#015) — 45/D

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 11 MC (steel payable) + 3 MC card = 14 MC cost. Action: -1 energy-prod → +1 TR (~7.2 MC value). Net: ~0.2 MC profit per use minus the 14 MC upfront cost. Need 2+ uses to break even.

**Почему D (45):** Bad card. Per Krazyguy75, even unused energy is worth ~6 MC as heat, so paying 14 MC upfront for an action that generates ~1 MC profit is terrible. Per ad_hocNC, people mistake the action cost for the total cost. Per benbever, sometimes playable late game with excess energy production, but at 14 MC for 1-2 points, it's rarely worthwhile. Building tag for steel payment is the only redeeming quality.

**Синергии:** Robinson Industries, Mass Converter, excess energy production, Mining Guild, steel dump

**Когда брать:** Late game with 3+ excess energy production and steel to pay for it. Very low priority otherwise.

---

### Heat Trappers (#178) — 45/D

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 6 MC + 3 MC card + 1 VP penalty = ~14 MC effective cost. Gain 7.5 MC (1 energy prod). Destroy ~8 MC (2 heat prod) from opponent. Net: you spend 14 MC, gain 7.5, destroy 8 from one opponent.

**Почему D (45):** Classic take-that card that helps the third player in 3P. You pay 14 MC effectively, gain only 7.5 MC, and hurt one opponent while the third player benefits free. -1 VP makes it worse. Much better in 2P but in our 3P format this is a losing play. Building tag and Robotic Workforce combo is the only saving grace.

**Синергии:** Robotic Workforce, Thorgate, Manutech

**Когда брать:** Only in 2P or if one opponent is running away with the game via heat production and you must slow them specifically.

---

### Magnetic Field Dome (#171) — 45/D

Стоимость: 5 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 5 MC + 3 MC card + 15 MC (2 energy prod) = ~23 MC for 1 TR (~7 MC) + 1 plant prod (~8 MC) + Building tag (~2 MC) = ~17 MC value. 6 MC deficit.

**Почему D (45):** Overcosted for what it provides. The 2 energy production cost is steep, and the return of 1 TR + 1 plant prod doesn't justify it in most situations. Only useful as a last-gen TR point with excess energy, or when the plant production enables an extra greenery in the final greenery phase. Building tag for steel payment is minor consolation.

**Синергии:** Last-gen excess energy, Colony energy surplus

**Когда брать:** Last gen with 2+ unused energy production and steel to dump. Otherwise skip. Never play early/mid game.

---

### Meltworks (#X26) — 45/D

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** Cost 4+3=7 MC (steel payable). Action: 5 heat (6 MC) -> 3 steel (6 MC). Net 0 per action. Building tag (1-2). Need heat surplus with steel targets.

**Почему D (45):** Very niche heat-to-steel converter that barely breaks even on the action. The 7 MC upfront cost means you need several uses just to recover investment. Only worthwhile with Advanced Alloys/Rego Plastics (3 steel = 9-12 MC). shai_aus and most COTD experts find it too situational. Building tag is the main appeal.

**Синергии:** Helion, Advanced Alloys, Rego Plastics, Electro Catapult, Space Elevator

**Когда брать:** Only with Advanced Alloys AND heat surplus AND steel targets. Or as a cheap building tag for Builder milestone.

---

### Rad-Suits (#186) — 45/D

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: 2 cities | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 9 MC total (6+3) for 1 MC-prod + 1 VP. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Effective cost ~4.5 MC for MC-prod and ~4.5 MC for VP. Both are overpriced.

**Почему D (45):** Awful card per Krazyguy75's analysis. No tags, low impact, essentially a worse TR for 9 MC. The 2 cities requirement is trivial but the card just does not do enough. shai_aus says 'fine for a point' but not impactful. Community Services synergy exists but is niche.

**Синергии:** Vitor (-3 MC), Community Services, Requirement milestones

**Когда брать:** Only as a last-gen VP dump when you have nothing better. Never draft early.

---

### Sulphur Exports (#250) — 45/D

Стоимость: 21 MC | Теги: Venus, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 21+3=24 MC (ti-payable) for 1 Venus TR (9 MC) + 1 MC-prod per Venus tag. With 3 Venus tags total: 9+15=24 MC value = break even. Need 4+ tags to profit.

**Почему D (45):** Too expensive for what it does. shai_aus compares it unfavorably to Satellites. Community consensus is D-tier unless you somehow have 4+ Venus tags, which is rare in all-expansions play. Venus tags are scarce and often not worth prioritizing for this payoff.

**Синергии:** Morning Star Inc, Venus Governor, Gyropolis, Stratopolis, Venuphile award

**Когда брать:** Only with 4+ Venus tags already in play/hand. MSI is the most common enabler. Otherwise skip.

---

### Black Polar Dust (#022) — 44/D

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC for 1 ocean (14 MC) + 3 heat-prod (12 MC) - 2 MC-prod (-10 MC). Net value ~16 MC. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty.

**Почему D (44):** Same cost as SP ocean but you lose 2 MC-prod and gain 3 heat-prod. The net production swap is roughly -1 MC-prod after TR from ocean. The no-tag penalty is significant -- zero synergy value. Heat production is less valuable than MC production in most games. Only playable for rushers who want heat for temperature and need an ocean. As COTD notes, it is underwhelming and rarely exciting.

**Синергии:** Helion, Ecoline (needs heat), Thermalist award

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 for rush strategy when you need both ocean and heat production. Skip if you value MC-prod or tags.

---

### Teslaract (#X66) — 44/D

Стоимость: 14 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 14+3=17 MC (steel-payable) for 1 TR (7 MC) + action: spend 1 energy-prod to gain 1 plant-prod. Power+Building tags. Plant-prod ~8 MC vs energy-prod ~7.5 MC: marginal gain per activation.

**Почему D (44):** icehawk84 compares to Soil Factory and gives D tier. The energy-to-plant conversion is marginal value (plant prod only slightly better than energy prod). 17 MC upfront for 1 TR and a weak action is poor. FieldMouse007 says 'situational, rarely great.' Only works with cheap excess energy production.

**Синергии:** Robinson Industries, Thorgate, Power Supply Consortium, Deuterium Export, NRA

**Когда брать:** Only with excess cheap energy production and a plant-based strategy. Very niche.

---

### Venus Soils (#257) — 44/D

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: Venus, Plant | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 20+3=23 MC for 1 Venus TR (9 MC) + 1 plant-prod (8 MC) + 2 microbes (~2-5 MC) + Venus+Plant tags (~3-4 MC). Total ~22-26 MC. Break-even but can't pay with steel/ti.

**Почему D (44):** shai_aus asks 'Why is it so expensive?' ad_hocNC agrees it's overpriced. The card gives a package of things you rarely all need together. Venus TR + plant-prod + microbes is a weird combo that doesn't suit most strategies. No steel/ti payment makes the 23 MC cash cost painful. Only worthwhile with NRA/Insects + microbe target + Venus need.

**Синергии:** NRA, Insects, GHG Producing Bacteria, Credicor discount, Psychrophiles/Dirigibles payment

**Когда брать:** Only when you need all three: Venus step, plant-prod, and microbe target. Very niche package deal.

---

### Aerosport Tournament (#214) — 44/D

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: {'floaters': 5, 'count': 5} | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for 1 MC per city in play (~5-8 MC in 3P) + 1 VP (5 MC). Requires 5 floaters. No tags (-3 to -5 MC). Total value ~10-13 MC. Net +0 to +3 MC but requirement is harsh.

**Почему D (44):** 5-floater requirement is very demanding -- needs a dedicated floater engine running for several gens. No tags provides zero synergy. The MC gain (1 per city) is mediocre in 3P (5-8 cities typically). 1 VP partially helps. For the effort of maintaining 5 floaters, the payoff is underwhelming. Compare to events that give similar MC without resource requirements. The card is only playable in deep floater strategies where you naturally accumulate 5+, but even then the payoff is too low for the opportunity cost of holding it.

**Синергии:** Floater engines, City-heavy games

**Когда брать:** Only when you happen to have 5+ floaters and many cities in play. Never draft speculatively. D-tier due to harsh requirement + low payoff + no tags.

---

### Banned Delegate (#T02) — 42/D

Стоимость: 0 MC | Требования: Chairman | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Turmoil

**Экономика:** 0+3=3 MC for removing 1 delegate. Value: 0-5 MC depending on timing (can secure chairman = 1 TR, or swing a party ruling). No tags. Chairman requirement is harsh.

**Почему D (42):** Very narrow card. The Chairman requirement means you can only play this when you are already Chairman, which is not frequent. Even when playable, removing 1 delegate is a minor effect. The no-tag penalty and event type with no tags give no synergy value. Can occasionally be valuable for securing a second term as Chairman or swinging a crucial party vote, but these moments are rare in 3P.

**Синергии:** Turmoil parties, Chairman strategies, IC (event cashback)

**Когда брать:** Very low priority. Only if you are frequently Chairman and need to manipulate party politics.

---

### Designed Microorganisms (#155) — 42/D

Стоимость: 16 MC | Требования: Max -14°C | Теги: Science, Microbe | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 16 MC + 3 MC card = 19 MC cost. Returns: 2 plant-prod (~16 MC gen1) + Science+Microbe tags (~5 MC). Total ~21 MC. Looks balanced, but plant-prod early is weak.

**Почему D (42):** Way too expensive for 2 plant production. The max -14°C requirement means it must be played early when 19 MC for plant production is a terrible investment — you want engine/economy cards, not slow greenery conversion. Per shai_aus (consistent across 3 COTD posts), this card is just too expensive. The Science tag is nice but not worth the price. Would need to be 3-4 MC cheaper to be playable.

**Синергии:** Ecoline, Cutting Edge Technology, Insects, NRA, Splice

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only if desperate for a Science tag with Ecoline going for early Gardener milestone.

---

### Icy Impactors (#X47) — 42/D

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo

**Экономика:** 15 MC + 3 MC card = 18 MC upfront. Then 10 MC per 2 asteroids = 1 ocean per 2 actions. First ocean: 18+10 = 28 MC + 2 actions. Subsequent: 10 MC + 2 actions each. Slow and you don't choose placement.

**Почему D (42):** Too slow and expensive for multiplayer. The upfront cost of 18 MC plus 10 MC per ocean (over 2 actions) is inefficient compared to direct ocean-placing events. Not choosing placement is a significant downside. The action-intensive nature means fewer productive turns. Only reasonable in solo where you have more control over game length.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Advanced Alloys

**Когда брать:** Almost never in 3P. Only if you have massive titanium surplus and no better space cards.

---

### Land Claim (#066) — 42/D

Стоимость: 1 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** 1 MC + 3 MC card = 4 MC to reserve a board spot. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Value depends entirely on the spot reserved.

**Почему D (42):** Very niche card that pays 4 MC to reserve a spot rather than just taking it. In 3P, blocking one opponent helps the third player. The no-tag penalty is significant. Occasionally useful for blocking ocean walks on Tharsis or grabbing a key spot. Much better in 2P. Best as a free draw where it costs only 1 MC. Not worth drafting in most situations.

**Синергии:** Arcadian Communities, Frontier Town, Legend milestone

**Когда брать:** Only as a free draw or when a specific board position is critical. Not worth drafting.

---

### Magnetic Field Generators (#165) — 42/D

Стоимость: 20 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 20 MC + 3 MC card + 28 MC (4 energy prod) = ~51 MC for 3 TR (~21 MC) + 2 plant prod (~16 MC) + tile (~2-4 MC) + Building tag. Total: ~39-41 MC value. ~10 MC deficit.

**Почему D (42):** Massively overpriced when you account for energy production cost. The 4 energy production requirement is nearly impossible to meet without a full science engine, and even then the value doesn't justify the cost. The Big Box buff adding a tile helps slightly. Only viable as a last-gen steel dump with excess energy from science cards. The 3 TR is nice but not at this price.

**Синергии:** Science engine excess energy, Last-gen steel dump, Builder milestone

**Когда брать:** Last gen with 4+ unused energy production and steel. Otherwise completely skip. One of the most overcosted cards in the game.

---

### Nitrite Reducing Bacteria (#157) — 42/D

Стоимость: 11 MC | Теги: Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 11+3=14 MC. Value: starts with 3 microbes. Action: +1 microbe or spend 3 microbes for 1 TR (7-7.4). First TR immediate. Then 1 TR per 3 actions = ~2.3 MC/action. Microbe tag (1-2).

**Почему D (42):** Too slow and expensive. 14 MC upfront for something that generates 1 TR immediately then 1 TR every 3 actions. shai_aus repeatedly rates it poorly across multiple COTD threads. ad_hocNC calls it bad and a trap for UNMI. The TR doesn't end the game faster (Venus-like). Only useful with microbe colony/external microbe sources.

**Синергии:** Extreme-Cold Fungus, Symbiotic Fungus, Decomposers, Enceladus colony, Imported Nitrogen

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only with multiple microbe-adding sources that make it produce TR faster.

### Parliament Hall (#T08) — 42/D

Стоимость: 8 MC | Требования: Mars First ruling | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil | VP: 1

**Экономика:** Cost 8+3=11 MC (steel payable). Value: 1 VP (5) + Building tag (1-2) + 1 MC-prod per 3 building tags. At 6 buildings = 2 MC-prod (10). Total ~16-17. Req: Mars First. Worse Medical Lab.

**Почему D (42):** Strictly inferior to Medical Lab: costs 5 MC less but gives 1 MC-prod per 3 tags instead of per 2, has a party requirement, and no science tag. Community consensus is D-tier. The VP makes it playable as a cheap steel dump but the production effect is too weak. benbever notes it's used mainly as a late-game 1VP steel dump.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Builder milestone, Mars First party, Steel payment

**Когда брать:** As a cheap 1VP steel dump with Mars First ruling. Don't draft for the production effect.

---

### Power Grid (#102) — 42/D

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: Power | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 18+3=21 MC. No steel/ti payment. Value: energy-prod per Power tag. At 3 tags = 3 energy-prod (22.5). At 2 tags = 2 (15). Power tag (1). Overpriced and circular.

**Почему D (42):** Overpriced energy production that can't be discounted by steel/titanium. If you already have enough Power tags to make it efficient, you probably already have enough energy. shai_aus, ad_hocNC, and FieldMouse007 all rate it poorly. The community notes it's likely overcosted by the game designers. Very niche, very situational.

**Синергии:** Thorgate, Physics Complex, Mass Converter requirement cards, Colonies (multi-fleet)

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only with 3+ existing Power tags and desperate need for energy. Thorgate makes it more playable.

---

### Space Mirrors (#076) — 42/D

Стоимость: 3 MC | Теги: Power, Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 6 MC total (3+3) for action: spend 7 MC for 1 energy prod. Only useful with colonies needing energy. Power+Space tags. 7 MC/energy is same as SP Power Plant minus the SP premium.

**Почему D (42):** The action is very expensive at 7 MC per energy production - same rate as a Standard Project. shai_aus says 'maybe a bit better than SP, but that is not high praise.' ad_hocNC recommends 'just do not play it ever and your winrate will go up.' Tags provide some value. Only niche use is Colonies when you desperately need energy without other options.

**Синергии:** Colonies (emergency energy), Power+Space tag needs

**Когда брать:** Almost never. The action is too expensive. Only if you desperately need energy for colonies.

### Steelworks (#103) — 42/D

Стоимость: 15 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 15+3=18 MC for an action spending 4 energy for 2 steel (6 MC) + 1 O2 TR (7 MC) = ~13 MC per action. Need 2+ activations to break even. Building tag worth ~1-2 MC.

**Почему D (42):** Oxygen bumpers are generally bad in multiplayer as greeneries handle O2 efficiently while providing VP. shai_aus prefers the titanium version. Steel output is hard to use without city cards. Very niche - only with excess energy (Mass Converter) and O2 not yet maxed.

**Синергии:** Mass Converter, Electro Catapult, Space Elevator, Thorgate, Factorum

**Когда брать:** Only when you have excess energy production and need to deny plant players O2 points. Rarely correct to play.

---

### Food Factory (#041) — 42/D

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12+3=15 MC for 4 MC-prod (20-24 MC gen 1) - 1 plant-prod (8 MC gen 1) + 1 VP (5 MC). Building tag (steel). Net: 12-16 MC value for 15 MC cost. ~+0 MC. Negative plant-prod trade is usually bad.

**Почему D (42):** Looks decent on paper (4 MC-prod + VP for 15 MC - 1 plant-prod) but the plant-prod sacrifice is a real cost. Plant production generates greeneries which are 1 TR + 1 VP each. Giving up 1 plant-prod means losing ~0.5 greenery over the game (~6 MC). The 4 MC-prod compensates economically but you lose the terraforming value. Building tag helps with steel payability. 1 VP partially offsets. The core problem: you are trading terraforming potential (plants) for pure economy (MC), which is usually wrong in WGT games where TR matters. Casinos gives 4 MC-prod without plant sacrifice.

**Синергии:** Steel production, MC-prod engines, Building strategies

**Когда брать:** Gen 1-2 only when plant-prod is genuinely excess (2+ plant-prod that cannot convert to greeneries fast enough). Steel-payable helps. Usually worse than alternatives.

### Rotator Impacts (#243) — 42/D

Стоимость: 6 MC | Требования: Max 14% Venus | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for action cycle: spend 6 MC → add asteroid, then spend asteroid → raise Venus 1 step (1 TR). Net: 6 MC + 2 actions → 1 TR (7 MC). ROI ~+1 MC per 2-action cycle. But need 2 actions per TR. Max 14% Venus req. Space tag (ti-payable).

**Почему D (42):** Classic slow Venus engine. Each TR requires 6 MC investment + 2 actions (2 gens). In 8-9 gen game, expect 2-3 TR from this card over 4-6 gens. That is 14-22 MC of TR for 9 MC upfront + 12-18 MC in action costs = 21-27 MC. Barely positive ROI. The max 14% Venus requirement limits play window. Space tag for ti-payability is the best quality. Compared to direct Venus raises this is painfully slow. Floater/resource action trap -- you spend 2 of your most valuable gens on this instead of better actions.

**Синергии:** Aphrodite (Venus raises), Space engines, Venus-light games for requirement

**Когда брать:** Only when Venus is low and you need cheap Venus raises over time. Space tag for ti-payability. Usually worse than direct Venus raise cards. Skip if better Venus options exist.

### Titan Air-scrapping (#C43) — 42/D

Стоимость: 21 MC | Теги: Jovian | Тип: active | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 2

**Экономика:** 21+3=24 MC for action cycle: spend 1 ti → 2 floaters → then spend 2 floaters → 1 TR. Net: 1 ti (3 MC) + 2 actions → 1 TR (7 MC). ROI ~+4 MC per 2-action cycle. But 24 MC upfront + ti cost + 2 VP (10 MC). Very slow.

**Почему D (42):** The 2-action TR cycle is painfully slow. Each TR costs 2 gens of actions + 1 titanium. In an 8-9 gen game after paying 24 MC upfront, you might get 2-3 TR over 4-6 gens. That is 14-22 MC of TR for 24 MC upfront + 2-3 ti (6-9 MC) = 30-33 MC total cost. The 2 VP (10 MC) helps but the ROI is terrible. Jovian tag is the redeeming quality. Compare to Big Asteroid (27 MC for 2 TR instantly + Space tag). Titan Air-scrapping is classic floater trap: expensive, slow, and action-intensive.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Jovian strategies, Hoverlord milestone

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only with excess ti-production and nothing better to spend it on. Jovian tag is the main draw. Classic floater trap -- avoid.

### Aerobraked Ammonia Asteroid (#170) — 40/D

Стоимость: 26 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 26+3=29 MC for 3 heat-prod (12 MC) + 1 plant-prod (8 MC) + 2 microbes (~2-4 MC). Total ~24 MC value. Overpays by 5 MC. Ti-payable helps.

**Почему D (40):** Too expensive for what it gives, as benbever notes the production is not discounted at all. 3 heat-prod is underwhelming without additional heat sources. 1 plant-prod alone produces nothing. The 2 microbes are hard to place gen 1 when you want to play this. Even with ti payment and Optimal Aerobraking, the card is below average. You want production early but this costs too much for mixed weak production.

**Синергии:** Optimal Aerobraking, Credicor, Phobolog, Psychrophiles, Regolith Eaters

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only with significant ti discount + Optimal Aerobraking + microbe card already in play.

### Insulation (#152) — 40/D

Стоимость: 2 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 2 MC + 3 MC card = 5 MC. Convert heat prod to MC prod 1:1. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Useful only when heat prod is no longer needed.

**Почему D (40):** Extremely niche card. No tags means no synergy value. Converting heat prod to MC prod is only useful when temp is maxed and you have excess heat production, which is uncommon in 3P games with WGT. Main use case is swinging Banker award. With Manutech you get MC when production changes. Otherwise nearly useless.

**Синергии:** Banker award, Manutech

**Когда брать:** Only when Banker award is funded and this could swing it, or temp is maxed and you have 3+ heat prod to convert.

### Martian Rails (#007) — 40/D

Стоимость: 13 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 13+3=16 MC. Action: spend 1 energy for X MC (X = cities on Mars). At 3 cities = 3 MC/action. Break-even at ~6 cities = gen 5+ typically. Energy cost = ~2 MC.

**Почему D (40):** Too expensive, too slow. In 3P games, experienced players don't build many cities, so this rarely reaches 4-5 MC/action. The energy cost is real. COTD experts (shai_aus, ad_hocNC, Krazyguy75) all rate it poorly. It breaks even at 6 cities which rarely happens early enough to matter.

**Синергии:** Tharsis Republic, City-heavy strategies, Colonies (for energy)

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only if the table is city-heavy and you have excess energy. Even then there are better options.

---

### Pioneer Settlement (#C29) — 40/D

Стоимость: 13 MC | Требования: 1 colonies | Теги: Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies | VP: 2

**Экономика:** Cost 13+3=16 MC + 2 MC-prod lost (10) = ~26 MC total. Value: colony (~13) + 2 VP (10) + Space tag (1-2). Total ~24-25 MC. Net ~-1 to -2 MC. Req: max 1 colony.

**Почему D (40):** The worst colony-placing card. The max 1 colony requirement means it can only be played gen 1-2 early, but losing 2 MC-prod early for VP is terrible economy. benbever calculates ~3.5 MC deficit. EspritFort rates it the worst colony card. Standard project colony is strictly better in most cases. Only niche use is late-game titanium dump for 2VP if you somehow still have 0-1 colonies.

**Синергии:** Phobolog, Vitor, Miranda colony (for late-game animals), Space tag discounts

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Late game with 0-1 colonies and titanium to spend. Even then it's marginal.

---

### Power Infrastructure (#194) — 40/D

Стоимость: 4 MC | Теги: Power, Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era

**Экономика:** Cost 4+3=7 MC (steel payable). Action: energy -> MC at 1:1 rate. Energy worth ~1.4 MC used, so losing ~0.4/energy. Power+Building tags (2-3).

**Почему D (40):** The action is almost always a bad trade since energy is worth more than MC when used properly (for trading, bumping, heat). The Power+Building tags for 7 MC steel-payable are the real value -- useful for Builder/Diversifier milestones. icehawk84 says he almost exclusively plays it for milestones. One of the weaker cards.

**Синергии:** Factorum, Builder milestone, Diversifier milestone, Cheap tag filler

**Когда брать:** Only for Builder/Diversifier milestone tags. The action is almost never worth using. Cheap steel dump.

---

### Soil Factory (#179) — 40/D

Стоимость: 9 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 12 MC total (9+3) + 1 energy prod (~7.5 MC) = effective ~19.5 MC for 1 plant prod (~8 MC) + 1 VP (~5 MC) + Building tag. Massively overpriced.

**Почему D (40):** Terrible card per community consensus. shai_aus calls it 'deceptively expensive.' Krazyguy75 says it is just the default cost of plant production with energy cost for a VP tacked on. No plant tag (can't enable NRA). One of the worst cards in the base game. Only playable as a last-gen steel dump with excess energy.

**Синергии:** Steel dump only, Builder milestone (desperate)

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Last-gen steel dump with spare energy if you need 1 VP. Bottom-tier card.

---

### Stratopolis (#248) — 40/D

Стоимость: 22 MC | Требования: 2 Science tags | Теги: City, Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next | VP: 1/3 resources

**Экономика:** 22+3=25 MC for 2 MC-prod (10 MC) + city tile + 1/3 VP floater action. Can't pay with steel/ti. benbever calculates: gen 1 play gives 14 MC back + 5 VP in 8-gen game, but 25 MC gen 1 is a massive hit.

**Почему D (40):** Overpriced at 25 MC with a science tag requirement. The 1/3 VP floater rate is terrible unless redirecting floaters to better Venus cards. Most commenters agree it's expensive and rarely sees play. The floaters can only go to Venus cards, severely limiting combo potential.

**Синергии:** Dirigibles, Aerial Mappers, Deuterium Export, Sulphur Exports, Hoverlord milestone

**Когда брать:** Only if heavily invested in Venus floater strategy with good targets for floaters. Very niche.

---

### St. Joseph of Cupertino Mission (#X64) — 40/D

Стоимость: 7 MC | Теги: — | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: special

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for action: add Cathedral to city (1 VP per Cathedral). No tags (-3 to -5 MC). Security Fleet v2 -- 1 action per VP. In 4 gens = 4 VP (20 MC) for 10 MC cost. But action economy is the bottleneck.

**Почему D (40):** Security Fleet variant with cities instead of fighters. Each action adds 1 VP to a city which sounds efficient, but the action cost is the real price. In 3P/WGT you have ~4-5 gens of actions. Using one action per gen on this vs. other action cards (AI Central: 2 cards/gen, Electro Catapult: 5 MC/gen) is usually worse. No tags means zero synergy value. The VP generation is linear (1/gen) vs. exponential engine cards. With 4 cities you could get 4 VP for 10 MC cost + 4 actions, but those 4 actions are worth ~20-30 MC in opportunity cost.

**Синергии:** City-heavy strategies, VP accumulation

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only when you have no better actions and plenty of cities. No tags and slow VP generation make it inferior to most action cards. Skip.

---

### Air Raid (#C02) — 38/D

Стоимость: 0 MC | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 0+3=3 MC + 1 floater (~3 MC) cost = 6 MC spent. Gain 5 MC, opponent loses 5 MC. In 3P: net swing against one player = 5 MC, but helps 3rd player free.

**Почему D (38):** The no-tag penalty and take-that pattern in 3P makes this weak. You spend 3 MC + a floater (worth 2-3 MC) to steal 5 MC. Net gain ~1-2 MC. In 3P the third player benefits from the targeted player being weakened. The floater cost is significant since floaters are usually needed for VP or other actions. Only okay if drawn for free with no floater opportunity cost.

**Синергии:** Media Group, Interplanetary Cinematics, Legend milestone, Titan colony

**Когда брать:** Only if drawn for free, have spare floaters, and can target the leader. Low priority in draft.

---

### Floater Leasing (#C10) — 38/D

Стоимость: 3 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 3 MC + 3 MC card = 6 MC cost. Returns: 1 MC-prod per 3 floaters you have. No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Typically 1-2 MC-prod mid-game if you have floater engine.

**Почему D (38):** Almost always garbage. Per shai_aus, 'mostly garbage.' Per FieldMouse007, in many games it sucks. The problem: you rarely have many floaters stored (most floater cards spend them), and when you do it's mid-late game when MC-prod is worth little. No tags compounds the weakness. Only playable with Titan Shuttles or Jovian Lanterns hoarding 10+ floaters, which is extremely niche.

**Синергии:** Titan colony, Titan Shuttles, Jovian Lanterns, Floating Habs, Celestic

**Когда брать:** Only when you already have 9+ floaters stored and 3+ gens remaining. Almost never draft this.

---

### Impactor Swarm (#C16) — 38/D

Стоимость: 11 MC | Требования: 2 Jovian tags | Теги: Space | Тип: event | Дополнение: Colonies

**Экономика:** 11 MC + 3 MC card = 14 MC for 12 heat (~15 MC at 1.25 each) + remove 2 plants (~3 MC). Requires 2 Jovian tags. Value: ~18 MC for 14 MC but timing is terrible.

**Почему D (38):** Bizarre card: Jovian players don't want heat (they want long games), and rush players rarely have 2 Jovian tags. The requirement creates a fundamental mismatch with the effect. Even when playable, 12 heat = ~1.5 temp raises which is mediocre for the setup required. Plant removal is minimal impact. Space tag for ti is the only real positive.

**Синергии:** Helion, Optimal Aerobraking, Thermalist award

**Когда брать:** Very rarely. Only when you're Jovian and need to convert titanium into temperature push in the final generation.

---

### Micro-Mills (#164) — 38/D

Стоимость: 3 MC | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** Cost 3+3=6 MC. Value: 1 heat-prod (4 MC). No tags = penalty (-3 to -5). Net: -5 to -7 MC. Only worth it to reach heat thresholds.

**Почему D (38):** Overpriced for what it does. No tags is a severe penalty. 6 MC for 1 heat production is barely break-even in gen 1 and bad any later. ad_hocNC notes it has some value for reaching 4 or 8 heat thresholds. COTD consensus is low/zero draft priority. The boring card meme is earned.

**Синергии:** Community Services, Generalist milestone, Thermalist award

**Когда брать:** Almost never in draft. Play if drawn free and it gets your heat production to a multiple of 8. Generalist milestone edge case.

---

### Security Fleet (#028) — 38/D

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Corporate Era | VP: 1/resource

**Экономика:** 15 MC total (12+3) for Space tag + action: spend 1 ti for 1 VP. Need ~6 uses to break even. That is 7 gens of play, which is near-impossible to profit from.

**Почему D (38):** Massive trap card. shai_aus says 'amassed lots of titanium with nothing to spend is not a position you want to be in.' Krazyguy75 calculates it needs 6+ activations to break even, calling it 'terrible.' ad_hocNC suggests it may be bottom 3 in the game. VP early is bad principle applies strongly here.

**Синергии:** Phobolog (only), Excess titanium with no space cards

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only as a last-gen titanium dump for VP, and even then the 15 MC upfront is steep.

---

### Thermophiles (#253) — 38/D

Стоимость: 9 MC | Требования: 6% Venus | Теги: Venus, Microbe | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 9+3=12 MC for action: add 1 microbe to Venus card or spend 2 for 1 Venus TR. 3 gens per TR = very slow. With extra microbe sources: 1 TR/2 gens is better. Venus+Microbe tags ~3 MC.

**Почему D (38):** Classic floater/microbe trap applied to Venus. Krazyguy75 gives a devastating critique: 12 MC for 1 TR every 3 turns, with a Venus 6% requirement. Even 2 TR total is mediocre. Microbes restricted to Venus cards limits targets. Only works with Extreme-Cold Fungus combo for 1 TR/gen.

**Синергии:** Extreme-Cold Fungus, Symbiotic Fungus, Enceladus colony, Ecologist milestone, Hoverlord

**Когда брать:** Only with an external microbe source feeding it every turn. Otherwise skip.

---

### Underground City (#032) — 38/D

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: City, Building | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 18+3=21 MC (steel-payable) + 2 energy-prod (15 MC) = 36 MC effective for city tile + 2 steel-prod (16 MC). Net loss ~20 MC. Terrible rate.

**Почему D (38):** Universal consensus that this is awful. shai_aus says 'least-favourite city card.' -2 energy-prod is punishing, and 2 steel-prod is less useful than MC-prod. Community agrees Noctis City does the same job much better. Only playable as a late-game cheap city (steel-payable) when you have excess energy. D tier.

**Синергии:** Electro Catapult, Space Elevator, Mayor milestone, Steel dump late game, Excess energy

**Когда брать:** Last gen only with excess energy-prod and steel to pay. Almost never correct to prioritize.

---

### Jet Stream Microscrappers (#234) — 36/D

Стоимость: 12 MC | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 12 MC + 3 MC card = 15 MC. Action: 1 titanium (~3 MC) for 2 floaters, OR spend 2 floaters for 1 Venus TR (~7 MC). 2 actions + 3 MC per Venus TR = slow and expensive.

**Почему D (36):** Classic floater trap. Requires 2 full actions (add floaters, then spend them) for 1 Venus TR, plus titanium cost. Over 8 gens starting gen 1: maybe 3-4 Venus TR for 15 + 12 MC in titanium = 27 MC. That's ~7 MC per Venus TR which is technically ok but the action cost is devastating. Venus track is the least important parameter. Most experienced players instant-pass this.

**Синергии:** Titan colony, Hoverlord milestone, Celestic

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only for Hoverlord milestone or if you have free floater placement. Floater trap card.

---

### Aquifer Pumping (#187) — 35/D

Стоимость: 18 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 18+3=21 MC upfront + 8 MC/ocean (in steel). 1st ocean: 29 MC. 2nd: 18.5/each. 3rd: 15/each. Need 3-4 oceans to approach fair value. In 3P only ~3 oceans per player.

**Почему D (35):** Mathematically bad in 3P/WGT. The first ocean costs 29 MC, and you need 3+ oceans to break even with standard project pricing. In 3P with ~3 oceans per player, you rarely get more than 2-3 uses. Only playable with Mining Guild or IC with massive steel surplus. The steel-payable action is the only redeeming quality. Mostly a trap card.

**Синергии:** Mining Guild, Interplanetary Cinematics, Rego Plastics, Advanced Alloys, Lakefront Resorts

**Когда брать:** Only with Mining Guild and no other ocean options, or IC with 20+ surplus steel.

---

### Dust Seals (#119) — 35/D

Стоимость: 2 MC | Требования: Max 3 oceans | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Base | VP: 1

**Экономика:** 2 MC + 3 MC card = 5 MC cost. Returns: 1 VP (~5 MC late game). No tags = -3 to -5 penalty. Max 3 oceans requirement limits to gen 1-2.

**Почему D (35):** One of the worst cards in the game. 5 MC for 1 VP is fair math, but buying VP in gen 1-2 is terrible strategy. The max 3 oceans requirement makes it a dead card most of the game. No tags means zero synergy value. Per benbever, only worth playing if received as a free card, with Vitor (+3 MC back), or for Sagitta (+4 MC). Occasionally helps Tactician on Hellas.

**Синергии:** Vitor, Sagitta, Community Services, Cutting Edge Technology, Tactician milestone

**Когда брать:** Almost never draft this. Only play if received for free or if specific synergies make it cheap enough.

---

### Ice Cap Melting (#181) — 35/D

Стоимость: 5 MC | Требования: 2°C | Теги: — | Тип: event | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 5 MC + 3 MC card = 8 MC for 1 ocean (1 TR ~7 MC + placement bonus ~2-3 MC). But requires +2C. In 95% of games, oceans are maxed before this is playable.

**Почему D (35):** Almost never playable. The +2C requirement means temperature must be near max, and by then oceans are virtually always gone. No tags compounds the problem with no synergy potential. When it works, it's amazing value, but that happens maybe 1 in 20 games. The risk of holding a dead card makes this a poor speculative draft.

**Синергии:** Special Design, Inventrix

**Когда брать:** Only late game when you see it's legal and oceans remain. Never draft early. Never hold in opening hand.

---

### Orbital Reflectors (#242) — 35/D

Стоимость: 26 MC | Теги: Venus, Space | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** Cost 26+3=29 MC (ti payable). Value: 2 Venus TR (14.8) + 2 heat-prod (8) + Venus+Space tags (3-5). Total ~26-28 MC. Net ~-1 to -3 MC. Internal anti-synergy.

**Почему D (35):** Critically anti-synergistic. Venus pushing is engine-oriented but heat production is rush-oriented. You're paying 29 MC for a card that doesn't coherently support either strategy. shai_aus calls it absolute garbage. Community consensus is D/F tier. The heat production on top of expensive Venus raising is design failure.

**Синергии:** Aphrodite, UNMI, Terraforming Deal, Morning Star Inc, Venuphile award

**Когда брать:** Almost never. Only if Venus is 1-2 steps from the 16% bonus TR and you need the Venus tag for Venuphile.

---

### Venus Magnetizer (#256) — 35/D

Стоимость: 7 MC | Требования: 10% Venus | Теги: Venus | Тип: active | Дополнение: Venus Next

**Экономика:** 7+3=10 MC for action: spend 1 energy-prod for 1 Venus TR. At face: 7.5 MC energy for 7 MC Venus TR = slight loss each time. Venus tag ~2-3 MC. Req Venus 10%.

**Почему D (35):** shai_aus and Krazyguy75 are both dismissive. The 10% Venus requirement means Venus is already 5 steps up, and most Venus payoff cards only need 12-18%. So this doesn't enable much. Spending energy-prod for Venus TR is a poor conversion. Only works with excess cheap energy (Robinson, Thorgate) in late game.

**Синергии:** Robinson Industries, Thorgate, Factorum, Excess energy production, Standard Technology

**Когда брать:** Very rarely. Only with excess energy-prod and Venus already high. One of the weaker Venus cards.

---

### Asteroid Hollowing (#X15) — 30/F

Стоимость: 16 MC | Теги: Space | Тип: active | Дополнение: Promo | VP: 1/2 resources

**Экономика:** 16+3=19 MC upfront + 1 ti (~3 MC)/action for 1 MC-prod + 1/2 VP. Over 5 gens: spend 15 ti = 45 MC total. Gain 15 MC-prod return + 2.5 VP (12.5 MC). Massive loss.

**Почему F (30):** One of the worst cards in the game, as COTD unanimously agrees. 19 MC upfront plus titanium per action for slow MC-production and 1/2 VP per asteroid is terrible ROI. The titanium is worth more spent on actual space cards. Even with Astrodrill synergy, the base card is too expensive and too slow. Classic trap card.

**Синергии:** Astrodrill, Asteroid Rights, Directed Impactors

**Когда брать:** Never. Even with Astrodrill, there are better uses for your titanium.

---

### Aerial Lenses (#T01) — 20/F

Стоимость: 2 MC | Требования: Kelvinists ruling | Теги: — | Тип: automated | Дополнение: Turmoil | VP: -1

**Экономика:** 2+3=5 MC for 2 heat-prod (8 MC) - 1 VP (5 MC) - 2 plants removed negligible value. Net ~3 MC. No tags. Kelvinists requirement is restrictive.

**Почему F (20):** As all COTD commenters agree, this card is terrible. 2 heat-production for 5 MC seems okay, but the -1 VP makes it a net loss. No tags means zero synergy value. The Kelvinists ruling requirement is restrictive and unreliable. You can get the same effect from the Kelvinist ruling policy itself. One of the worst cards in the game.

**Синергии:** Helion, Kelvinists party

**Когда брать:** Never. Even in the rare Kelvinists scenario, the -1 VP makes this a trap.

---

### Underground Detonations (#202) — 15/F

Стоимость: 6 MC | Теги: Building | Тип: active | Дополнение: Base

**Экономика:** 6+3=9 MC for action: spend 10 MC for 2 heat-prod (8 MC). Net loss 2 MC per activation. Building tag ~1-2 MC. One of the worst cards in the game.

**Почему F (15):** shai_aus's legendary roast says it all - use cases include 'bonfire fuel' and 'bank robbery calling card.' Spending 10 MC for 2 heat-prod (worth 8 MC) is negative value every activation. The Building tag for Builder milestone is literally the only use case. Universally considered one of the worst cards.

**Синергии:** Builder milestone (desperate), Helion (slightly less bad), Thermalist award (maybe), Nothing else, Still nothing

**Когда брать:** Never. If you play this card voluntarily, something has gone terribly wrong.
